mosquito
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yeahyeahyeahs/mosquito.html

Mosquito, mosquito, mosquito

Mosquito sing, mosquito cry
Mosquito live, mosquito die

Mosquito drink most anything
Whatever's left, mosquito scream

I'll suck your blood...

Mosquito sing, mosquito cry
Mosquito live, mosquito die

Mosquito land on your neck
Mosquito drink whatever's left

He'll suck your blood...

They can see you but you can't see them
They can see you but you can't see them
So are you gonna let them in?
They're hiding underneath your bed
Crawling between your legs
They're sticking it in your vein
Were you itching when they called your name?
Were you itching when they called your name?

They'll suck your blood

Off with your head
Dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all chrome

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

The men cry out
The girls cry out
The men cry out
The girls cry out
The men cry out
Oh no

The men cry out
The girls cry out
The men cry out
The girls cry out
The men cry out
Oh no

Off, off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead (dead)
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome
You're all chrome

Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead

Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,

Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,

Take our hands out of control,

Take our hands out of control


Now, tell me what you saw,

Tell me what you saw,

There was a crowd of seeds,

Inside, outside,

I must have done a dozen each


It was the height I threw, the weight,

The shell was crushing you,

I've been around a few


Tell me what you saw,

I'll tell you what to...

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh


Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,

Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,

Take our hands out of control,

Take our hands out of control


Outside, Inside,

This is the moon without a tide,

We'll build a fire in your eyes,

We'll build a fire when the cover's getting brighter,

Cold desire makes the moon without a tide


Tell me what you saw,

I'll tell you what to...

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh


Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ohh ohh

slave

It eats your soul, like tears you fall, my slave
You steal, you heed the call, my slave
The keys, the keys are gone, my slave
You keep me beating on

It eats your soul, like tears you fall, my slave
You steal, you heed the call, my slave
You keep me, you keep me, your slave
You keep me, you keep me, your slave

On my own
You keep me, you keep me
On the throne
Heads down all day
On my own
You keep me, you keep me
On the throne
Heads down all day

Come feed on your love

buriedalive

Free yourself that leash is long long long 
[x4]

I dreamt...
I was buried alive

[x4]

Prognostic figure of speech to manifesto
Dr. Octagon move in the dark though
Multiply darkness, I'm the bright artist
Hologram image on the interface
Manage the code to bury them alive
Manage the code to bury them inside
Show smoke from the smoke machine
Lights on the top flash purple and green
Purple and mean, rise with the vampires
Look over skies from a high-rise
Doc Oc operate by the clock
Medicine bag come down by your block
Raise the dead, hypnotize with your head
Chemical react surgery to your head
Eyeballs up all night turn red

Free yourself that leash is long long long 
[x4]

I was buried alive, I was buried alive, I was buried alive 
[x3]

Turn red...

pin
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yeahyeahyeahs/pin.html

things are feeling thin i know, i know

lost my seat again where i'll go, i'll go,

pushing in the pin

i know, i know

we're gonna go back in

we're gonna go go go


[Chorus x4 (a lot of bahs and dontos)]


i like to sleep with them

pushing in the pin

i like to sleep with them

i know, i know

we're gonna go back in

we're gonna go go go

we're gonna go back in

we're gonna go go go


[Chorus x4]

[end]
