In my eyes
Indisposed
In disguise
As no one knows
Hides the face
Lies the snake
And the sun
In my disgrace

Boiling heat
Summer stench
'Neath the black
The sky looks dead
Call my name
Through the cream
And I'll hear you
Scream again


[Chorus:]
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

Stuttering
Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind
Tired friend
Times are gone
For honest men
And sometimes
Far too long
For snakes

In my shoes
A walking sleep
And my youth
I pray to keep
Heaven send
Hell away
No one sings
Like you anymore


[Chorus 2x]

(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)

Hang my head
Drown my fear
'Til you all just disappear


[Chorus 2x]

(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
(Black hole sun,
Black hole sun)
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

Whatsoever I've feared has

Come to life

Whatsoever I've fought off

Became my life

Just when everyday

Seemed to greet

Me with a smile

Sunspots have faded

And now I'm doing time

Cause I fell on

Black days


Whomsoever I've cured

I've sickened now

Whomsoever I've cradled

I've put you down

I'm a search light soul

They say but I can't

See it in the night

I'm only faking

When I get it right

Cause I fell on

Black days

How would I know

That this could be my fate


So what you wanted to

See good has made you blind

And what you wanted to

Be yours has made it

Mine

So don't you lock up

Something that you

Wanted to see fly

Hands are for shaking

No not tying


I sure don't

Mind a change

But I fell on black

Days

How would I know

That this could be

My fate

And you stare at me

In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out

Like you've been carrying a load

And you swear to me

You don't want to be my slave

But you're staring at me

Like I need to be saved

In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out

In your Jesus Christ pose

Thorns and shroud

Like it's the coming of the Lord

And I swear to you

That I would never feed you pain

But you're staring at me

Like I'm driving the nails

In your Jesus Christ pose

And you stare at me

In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out like it's

The coming of the Lord

And would it pay you more to walk on water

Than to wear a crown of thorns

It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich

Than to bury you poor

In your Jesus Christ pose

I'm entering

On wings I've found

A million miles

Of covered ground

I'm entering, I'm entering yeah

Well I'm entering, yeah, yeah


I'm entering

Bleeding hearts, two lights, goodness, stable

Glass on bars won't hold me back

Without a sound

Or a thought

I'm entering

I'm entering


Oh yeah without a sound

I'm entering, entering

On wings I've found

A million, million miles, a million miles

Well I'm entering, entering, entering, entering, entering, entering yeah

In the night
In the city
Alone in my room
Oh, wall to wall

Touch me, can you feel it
Touch me, it feels good
Touch me, yeah I can feel it
(I got the feeling)
Touch me

Couldn't get to sleep in my room last night
Something isn't quite the same
Just as I was reaching for the nearest light
I heard somebody calling my name

Touch me, can you feel it
Touch me, it feels good
Touch me, yeah I can feel it
(I got the feeling)
Touch me

Oh yeah
All right now

Shivers down my backbone because my man is back
And my pulse began to race
Oh, when she laid beside me everything went black
Because I've seen the strangest things

Touch me, can you feel it
Touch me, it feels good
Touch me, yeah I can feel it
(I got the feeling)
Touch me

Standing whit my enemies

Hung on my horns

With haste and reverie

Killing with charm


Only happy when you hurt

Only deadly in a swarm

Only healthy in the dirt

Only empty in your arms


I play, I'm sick and tame

Drawing the hordes

I wait, and show the lame

The meaning of harm

The skulls beneath my feet

Like feathers in sand

I graze among the graves

A feeling of peace


Only bending when you break

Only feeding when you're cold

Only healing when you ache

Only feeling when you don't

I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you're no scare-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs
This ain't no hanging matter
No, this ain't no capital crime

Ya I can see that you're just fifteen years old
But I don't want your I.D.
Ya I can see that you're so far from home
This ain't no hanging matter,
No it ain't no capital crime


[Chorus:]
Oh yeah, you're a stray stray cat
Oh yeah, you're a stray stray cat
Oh yeah, you're a stray stray cat

I bet your momma never saw you fight like that
I bet your momma never saw you scratch my back

You like to get yourself those 
[?]
 from home
But I know you miss your mother
You look so scared out of my man made bed
This ain't no hanging matter
No, this ain't no capital crime


[Chorus]

I bet your momma never heard you spit like that
I bet your momma never saw you scratch my back

I see your girlfriend and she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs
She's wild enough that she can join in too
This ain't no hanging matter
No, this ain't no capital crime


[Chorus]

I bet your momma never saw you fight like that
I bet your momma never saw you scratch my back
I bet your momma never saw you
I bet your momma never heard you spit like that

I bet your momma never told you
I bet your momma never told you
I bet your momma never told you you scratch like that
Oh yeah, Oh yeah

We see the vipers of distance

Crawl into our lives everyday

Breeding our Edens of hatred

Pathetically stupid and unkind

We couldn't look a saint in the eyes


On the storm

It's time to go

On the storm

It's time to go


Marching in ines of contradiction

Forgetting the history we make

Loving our hangmen as the penultimate joke

We lack the Moses... to look

A saint in the eye
[end]
