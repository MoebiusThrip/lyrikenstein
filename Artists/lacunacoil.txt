underdog
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/underdog.html

You are going down
Down

At the bottom I have found
I cannot wait to get back in the fight

And send you straight to the ground
Hide and seek
When I'm on the ropes
You wanna knock me down, knock me down
Your cheap shots are  denied

You're going down
You can't kill my soul and kill me dream
Back down
Now
You will understand me now
You don't want to come back to the fight
I've been the underdog all my life
I can feel it
I will not stop until I see you down
On the ground
Cause I am still alive
[end]
veinsofglass
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/veinsofglass.html

These ghosts I keep inside
shards of glass in my veins
release me from myself, release
from my duality

I face these as a soldier would
but useless is my war
the innocence that smiles today
tomorrow will bee lying

Who is it that really dies when all the people look at me?
And I'm twisting my fingers in my hair
while a mirror reflects me

Now I'm digging to the bone
all the painting
scratching at flesh, drives me mad
to be alive and free

And the ghosts I keep inside myself
how do they see me?
while again I'm drowning
with my soul will you save me?
[end]
swamped
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/swamped.html

When you're taught through feelings

Destiny flying high above
all I know is that you can realize it

Destiny who cares
as it turns around
and I know that it descends down on me

It's just another day
the shame is gone
hard to believe
that I've let it go

Destiny can't replace my life
Scary shadows of my past
are alive

Destiny who cares
as it turns around
and I know that it descends
with a smile

It's just another day
the shame is gone
it's hard to believe
that I've let it go away

It's just a melody
it bleeds in me
hard to believe
that I've let it go
[end]
theghostwomanandthehunter
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/theghostwomanandthehunter.html

Staring at the sun
no rays down on me
I call you in my arms
embrace is unreal

You're moving on
we'll never be apart
just drain my tears
I cry aloud

You're moving on
you'll never be a part
of all my tears
I cry aloud

Calling on your sins
you're here in my dreams
a desert place
I'm not alone

Do you really
want to be me?

You're moving on
we'll never be apart
just drain my tears
I cry aloud

You're moving on
you'll never be a part
of all my tears
I cry aloud
[end]
thegame
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/thegame.html

Will I just tell you to give up?
No matter how you'll play this game
But I can handle the sorrow
Whatever time is running out

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relieving my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind

Will I be such a dreamer?
No matter how I'll play this game
To get is symptom of giving
Whatever time is over now

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relieving my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relieving my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind
[end]
cold
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/cold.html

Skin so cold
I knew you'd go away
and now I put you down to lay
nothing to feel for you
this was our last dance

Closer and closer, it's time to surrender
to the desire that you cannot mention
don't try to breathe
don't try to run away

But I'm reaching for the sky (going to fly)
won't you please stay

With a smile I watch you go
you'll never know I didn't cry
with a smile I saw you die
you'll never know I didn't cry

No more fear
they said you were so weak
and now I put you down to lay
nothing to feel for you
this was our last dance
[end]
devoted
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/devoted.html

I'll be there when there's nothing left.
And night and day, holding you.
Harmony, deep inside your soul.
Meet me there.

Can you feel me?
(Can you feel me?)
Can you feel me deep inside?

There's no time to deny that I need you.
And I'll be there to repair your delightful days.
There's no time to deny that I need you.
That's why I'll be there to relieve your painful days.

Hiding well where the pain is real.
Night and day, growing you.
In the haze, poison in your veins.
Meet me there.

Can you feel me?
(Can you feel me?)
Can you feel me deep inside?

There's no time to deny that I need you.
And I'll be there to repair your delightful days.
There's no time to deny that I need you.
That's why I'll be there to relieve your painful days.

Deep inside.

There's no time to deny that I need you.
And I'll be there to repair your delightful days.
There's no time to deny that I need you.
That's why I'll be there to relieve your painful days.

tightrope
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lacunacoil/tightrope.html

Delighthing minds
with my shadow
Rely on your way to grow
You want to decide
from your cloud
You're lost in a world
that I have to repair

You want it all
the greatest smile
Who wants to deny forever?
You're made of ice
I pay the price
for all you unforgiveness

Enlighting lies
with my shame
Beneath the veil
of your flow
Don't try to deny
with your mouth
So fine it is knowing
you're under the shade
[end]
