Snuff the punk
I'm gettin' tired of you chump
Bass in your face
You'll get a taste fo the P.O.D. funk
When I say punk or chump I don't mean you
Talkin' 'bout the devil and his crew
Check me out
You came to rob and steal from the helpless
Warriors in Christ we stand up for the defenseless
So can you get with this, then please step to this
And if you say yes, sign the P.O.D. checklist
This is a spiritual war, we take no prisoners
Live a life of sin, you don't know what you're getting into
You picked a winner, love the sinner, hate the sin dude
We got a plan, understand, here's what we're gonna do
Snuff the punk, snuff the punk
Snuff 'em, snuff 'em
Snuff the punk, snuff the punk

Snuff the punk, snuff the punk
Snuff 'em, snuff 'em
Snuff the punk, snuff the punk

P.O.D. hit me one more time for those that don't be known
Merrily, merrily, merrily, down the streams is how I'm flowin'
Keep goin' don't stop, all props to my pops
P.O.D. the gospel, the gospel, that rocks
Rock you, we did it, I think it's time to quit it
And when my king is speaking, yo you better take a seat kid
The shield of God ain't nothin' gonna hurt me
And like too ruff, we're gettin' down and dirty
I told you once before homie, this is the real deal
No time to win your soul, it's too late, we gotta steal it
Blinded by ignorance, use some common sense
It's too close to the end to be walking on the fence
Rough so tough, God challenged my bluff &quot;G&quot;
I thank the Lord the day he snuffed a punk like me

Snuff the punk, P.O.D. snuff the punk
Snuff the punk, P.O.D. snuff the punk
Snuff the punk, P.O.D. snuff the punk
Snuff the punk, P.O.D. snuff the punk

badboy
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pod/badboy.html

I like a girl with big ol' eyes
Cause I could see her mind, body and soul harmonize
And she's so fine, I can't say love is blind
But I know it got me shook, got me mesmerized.
The kind of girl when she steps in the room
You know she steps to her own tune
She's got a custom fitted, one of a kind gown to the ball
Not someone else's costume! 
And Miss Right don't come in two's
So I'm careful -bout who I choose
These little floozies can dance on my cues
They're wasting time trying to fill your shoes


[Chorus:]
And I'm a bad boy, but I like good girls
The kind you wanna take home to meet your momma
You know that I'm a bad boy and I wanna good girl
To share my world
And show you how I do it!

And girl you know how I do, girl you know you've heard of my crew
And girl, I'm looking for a love that's true
Not some other ho to do
But when it's all set and done I need more than a hit and run
But don't get me wrong, you could be real fun
But it's time for me to find the one
The one I want to spend the rest of my life with, 
The one to have too many kids with
So I'ma wife you up and make it right
Gonna turn you to a freak tonight, come on! 


[Chorus:]
And I'm a bad boy, but I like good girls
The kind you wanna take home to meet your momma
You know that I'm a bad boy and I wanna good girl
To share my world
And show you how I do it!

Undying love, that' what I'm after
Like Mark Anthony and Cleopatra 
I need a girl who's down to ride
I need a Bonnie and I can be your Clyde
I wanna girl I could love to death like Romeo and Juliet


[Chorus:]
And I'm a bad boy, but I like good girls
The kind you wanna take home to meet your momma
You know that I'm a bad boy
I'm a bad boy! But I, 
I want a good girl to share my world
To show you how I do it! 

When the party's over you are there,
Girl you're teasing me but I'm gonna wait cuz I wanna
Take you home to meet my mama, cuz I, I wanna good girl
To share my world and show you how I do it

This little one tries as hard as she can

Do anything just so she could fit in

She wants a friend so bad she'll do whatever they tell her

To make them smile she would misbehave

But all the while they would laugh in her face

She begins to cry because she thought that they liked her


Even though you feel all alone

It can't rain everyday

It don't rain forever

Your sunshine may be gone but i know

It can't rain everyday

It don't rain forever


He works hard everyday of his life

For his son on the way and his beautiful wife

But today he got a call from his job they got something to tell him.

They laid him off now he's out on the streets

He's got to do what it takes so his family can eat

He can't even look at his wife because he feels like he failed them


[chorus]


Reign down! reign down! reign down! so let it reign down!

Reign down! reign down! reign down on me now!


A young lady's been lost for awhile

But that's ok now she's having a child

She finally got what she wants. she's got someone who loves her

But this morning she woke up in pain. 

Nobody had to tell her because she knew right away

So she started to cry because she won't be a mother.


[chorus]


Reign down! reign down! reign down! reign down on me!

Reign down! reign down! reign down!
[end]
