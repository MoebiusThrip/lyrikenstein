[Advertisement:]
This morning you've got time for a hot home-cooked breakfast.
Delicious and piping hot in only 3 microwave minutes.

Are you kidding?


[Dave:]
Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights.

-Look, it comes with a toy he he, I like that. I wanna number 4, a number 6, and throw in a plastic dough-nut.

Just enjoy the gritty crunch, that tastes just like chicken.
Wrappers of many bite sizes.

-Man, are you freaking blind? That's a rock.

All mixed in the potful.
Momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite.
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right.


[Posdnuos and (Dave):]
All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers.
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders.
Don't waste time with your net.
Our net worth is set.
Ready, go.
Many know others, what?

We be the colors of the mad
And the wicked.
We be bad,
We re-brick it
With the 24-hour sign.
Shower my habits
While you dine like rabbits.
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots.

-Oh, that's chicken.

Gotta have it super fast!


[Advertisement:]
-A whole lot of breakfast you got time for!


[Gruff Rhys:]
Super fast, super fast.
I come in last,
But just in time for breakfast.
Keep us through, keep us through,
Forever blue.
The night, the night throws at us.
Aluminum, I crush your fun.
Aluminum.
The sea is radioactive.
The sea is radioactive.


[Posdnuos and (Dave):]

-Oh, that's chicken.

Gotta have it super fast!


[2D:]
Super fast, super fast.
I come in last,
But just in time for breakfast.
Keep us through, keep us through,
Forever blue.
Tonight the night throws at us.
Aluminum, I crush your fun.
Aluminum.
The sea is radioactive.
The sea is radioactive.


[2D and (Posdnuos):]
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.

-Don't waste time!

Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.
Superfast jellyfish.

-A sea has gone green. What?

Everybody loves jellyfish! 
[4x]
Superfast jellyfish.

Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good

Shake it, (shake) shake it (shake) - shake it, (shake) feel good (shake)

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon it's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Lining them up like ass cracks,
Ladies, ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care Bear rappin' it harder this year
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahahaa.

Yo, we gonna go ghost town,
This motown,
With your sound
You're in the blink
Gonna bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With your sound
You kill the INC.
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you jet ahead.
Yo, watch the way I navigate
Hahahahahhaa

Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good 
[4x]

Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Don't stop, shit it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady,
Watch me navigate,
Ahahahahahhaa.

Don't stop, shit it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady,
Watch me navigate
Ahahahahahhaa

Feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good
Shake it, shake it, shake it, feel good

Up on melancholy hill
There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream

Well, you can't get what you want but you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarine
'Round the world we'll go
Does anybody know, love?
If we're looking out on the day of another dream

If you can't get what you want then you come with me

Up on melancholy hill sits a manatee
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

When you're close to me

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

Yeah... Ha Ha!
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe.
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you on the high shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence the basics
Without did you make it
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future
