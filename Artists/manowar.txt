Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.

I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.

Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword

There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

She Is Waiting To Kiss My Hand
But She Will Wait For My Command
My Chains And Collar Brought Her To Her Knees
She Now Is Free To Please
Woman Be My Slave
That's Your Reason To Live
Woman Be My Slave
The Greatest Gift I Can Give
Woman Be My Slave
Before Her Surrender She Had No Life
Now She's A Slave Not A Wife
Her Only Sorrow Is For Women Who Live With Lies
She's Taken Off Her Disguise
Woman Be My Slave
Chained Unto My Bed
Woman Be My Slave
Begging To Be Fed
Your Body Belongs To Me
Woman Come Here
Remove Your Garments
Kneel Before Me
Please Me
Woman Be My Slave
Chained Unto My Bed
Woman Be My Slave
Begging To Be Fed
I Want You Now
Woman Be My Slave

handofdoom
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/manowar/handofdoom.html

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die


[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand

High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived


[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Old man and young boys, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker
Since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen
I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no
No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching &quot;Billy Graham&quot; on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me
Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, Fast Taker, Bed Breaker, Love Maker
Take it away
Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy's been a drinker

Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,
The  black,and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free

To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free


[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again

Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years


[Repeat chorus]

Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song


[Repeat chorus to fade]

[end]
