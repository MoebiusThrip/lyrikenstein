Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer
Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer

Since dawn of time the fate of man is that of lice
Equal as parasites and moving without eyes
A day of reckoning when penance is to burn
Count down together now and say the words that you will learn

Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, Welcome year zero
Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, Welcome year zero

Belial, Behemoth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satanas, Lucifer

Crestfallen kings and queens comforting in their faith
Unbeknownst to them is the presence of the wraith
Since fate of man is equal to the fate of lice
As new dawn rises you shalt recognize now behold the Lord Of Flies

Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, Welcome year zero
Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, Welcome year zero
Hell Satan


[Guitar solo]

He will tremble the nations.
Kingdoms to fall one by one
Victim to fall for temptations
A daughter to fall for a son
The ancient serpent deceiver
To masses standing in awe
He will ascend to the heavens
Above the stars of god.

Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, Welcome year zero
Hell Satan, Archangelo
Hell Satan, Welcome year zero.

In this your time of need
You're turning to the light
You had just begun to explore the dark
In the urban night

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
Our funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore

You're so God damn frail
Failing for a change
You just had to know all about the world
But you will never know
'Cause no one ever told you how

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forever

The world is on fire
And we are tied as one eternally
Our funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore

All of your imaginations
Are now running down your face
All of your imaginations
Are now running down your face

Oh, you are looking good
Bareback in disgrace
And you are doing fine worshipping your lord
Standing in his grace
'Cause no one ever told you how

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forever

The world is on fire
And we are tied as one eternally
Our funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore

This grave hill stinks of death
A reek from the ground
Catches whiff of the hound
A dead ones breath
The casket lid is cold
Waiting inside
Is someone petrified
That odours old

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah

Son of God
The bitter taste is sweet
So eat Nazarene
And you kiss the obscene
Anointed feet

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah

Son of God
Receive, consume
Receive, consume
Digest
Defecate

His body and blood
Sharing in common
His body and blood
His body and blood
Serving Messiah
Son of God

Tanning in Lucifer's beams

absolution
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ghostbc/absolution.html

Ever since you were born you've been dying
Every day a little more you've been dying
Dying to reach the setting sun

As a child, with your mind on the horizon
Over corpses, to the prize you kept your eyes on
Trying to be the chosen one

All those things that you desire
You will find here in the fire

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

Even now when you're here you are moving
Hysterically seeking out what needs improving
And you're still asking for the sun

All those things that you desire
You will find here in the fire

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

You'll cry
You'll cry
You'll cry
You'll cry
You'll cry
You'll cry

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

Put your hands up and reach for the sky
Cry for absolution
You'll be down on your knees and you'll cry
Cry for absolution

By whom all things will be unmade

From thense he shall come to judge
Out of one substance

Whose kingdom shall haveth no end

Say, can you see the cross?
Inverted solemnly
Symbol for the goat
Of a thousand young

Six six six
Evoke the king of hell
Strike the death knell
Death knell

Say, can you hear the chimes?
Tolls now for the end
Bells call out their doom
As victor reaches womb

Sex sex sex
Recieve the beast of evil
Of evil...

Can you say his name?
Carrier of the light
Legions of this seed
A child a spouce will feed

S-A-T-A-N
Under spell
of death knell
Death knell

majesty
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ghostbc/majesty.html

A higher power underground
From seraph skies and now to chaos bound
Hes sitting sacred and profound
In midst of sinners lifting up to kiss his crown

Pathetic humans in despair
Defaced, deflowered, now to death devout
A fallen angel in His lair
In midst of sinners kneeling down before his clout

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

This oasis is a poison well
Of rotting carcasses that clog the deep
A prince in exile here in Hell
In midst of sinners flocking up like soulless sheep

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within
Old One,
Master
All beauty lies within you

...Your Infernal Majesty

Underneath the moonlight of old hungerian skies
buried in the blood-drenched earth
These barren lands of ice
She was an evil woman with an evil old soul
Piercing eyes emotionless
a heart so black and cold

Elizabeth, in the chasm where was my soul
Forever young, Elizabeth Bathorii in the castle of your death
You're still alive, Elizabeth

Her pact with Satan
Her disposal of mankind
Her acts of cruelty and her lust for blood
Makes her one of us

Our ancient countess was refused her desires will
To bathe in pure fresh blood
She'd peasant virgins killed

Elizabeth, in the chasm where was my soul
Forever young, Elizabeth Bathorii in the castle of your death
You're still alive, Elizabeth

Elizabeth, in the chasm where was my soul
Forever young, Elizabeth Bathorii in the castle of your death
You're still alive, Elizabeth

I was carried on a wolf's back
Here to corrupt humanity
I will pommel it with opulence
With corpulence and greed
In god you trust

My mummy dust
My mummy dust

Your cavalier of crapulence
To this feast of rapacity
I will bury you in treasures
Just to feed your incapacity
In god you trust

My mummy dust
My mummy dust

You are the possesse of avarice
I am the ruler of the earth
I will smother you in riches
Until you choke in sordid mirth

You are summoned in cupidity
Purulence and lust
I am the magnet for stupidity
Divine you feel my thrust
In god you trust

My mummy dust
My mummy dust

In god you trust

I'm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity

There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon

I've been waiting for the night to fall
Iknowthat it would save us all
Now everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

I've been waiting for the night to fall
Now everything is bearable
And here in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity

There is a sound in the calm
Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
It's easier here just to forget fear

And when I squinted
The world seemed rose-tinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With half-closed eyes
Things looked even better
Than when they were opened

There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon

There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon

You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward bound
Pushed around refugee

Something's wrong
Got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from out of space
Out of place, like King-Kong

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Like a doll
Like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk
How to walk, how to fall

Can't complain
I've got no one but myself to blame
Something's happening
I can't control
Lost my hold, it's insane

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

Look this way
Just a little smile
That's what they say
You'll look better on the photograph
If you laugh, that's OK!!

I'm a marionette
Just a marionette
Pull the string
I'm a marionette
Everybody's pet
Just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette
See my pirouette
'Round and 'round
I'm a marionette
I'm a marionette
Just a silly old clown

You're so free

We conquered a magic
We counted the stars
Deciphered the clockwork
Enacted this farce

Devoured by shadows
We cling to the light
Deluded by wisdom
The bringer of night

Now and for always
A perpetual rise
A fall of illusion
Your zenith fades into eternity

Time will soon be gone
Right will turn to wrong
Winds come on strong
So help you God
Come unleashed
You're set free

A genesis captured
Ignited by truth
A martyrdous rapture
A vision to see

Devoured by shadows
We cling to the light
Deluded by wisdom
The bringer of night

Now and for always
A perpetual rise
A fall of illusion
Your zenith fades into eternity

Time will soon be gone
Right will turn to wrong
Winds come on strong
So help you God
Come unleashed
You're set free

Saecula Saeculorum

Time will soon be gone
Right will turn to wrong
Winds come on strong
So help you God
Come unleashed
You're set free

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

You know that the fog is here, omnipresent
When the diseases sees no cure
You know that the fog is here, omnipresent
When the intents remain obscure
Forevermore

Weave us a mist
Fog weaver, ooh-ooh
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable wall-less maze
A secular haze

You know that his son is near, omnipotent
When she sees eye to eye with spear
You know that his son is near, omnipotent
When youth and innocence disappear
Forever lost

Weave us a mist
Fog weaver, ooh-ooh
Hide us in shadows
Unfathomable, wall-less maze
A secular haze

He is divinity omniscient
Seeing the world revolve with spite
The surge of humanity oblivious
To the divine whom bringeth light
Let there be night

Weave us a mist
Fog weaver
Hide us in shadows
Fog weaver

Come mist eternal, ooh-ooh
Come mist eternal, ooh-ooh
Come secular haze.

Putrefaction
A scent that cursed be
Under coat of dust
From the darkness
Rise a succubus
From the earthen rust

Haresis dea
Once a majesty
Now exposing bone
From the darkness
Rise a succubus
And usurp the throne

The moon is full and shines
An evil blinding light
Under a monolith, her likeness
Marble white

Zombie Queen
Zombie Queen
Black light guides you!
Ghuleh... Ghuleh...

Zombie Queen
Zombie Queen
Black light guides you!
Ghuleh... Ghuleh...

Up from the stinking dirt
She rises ghastly pale
Shapeshifting soon...
But now she's rigid, stiff and stale

Black light guides you!

Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?

I know your soul is not tainted
Even though you've been told so
Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?

I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you

A candle casting a faint glow
You and I see eye to eye
Can you hear the thunder?
Can you hear the thunder that's breaking?

Now there is nothing between us
From now our merge is eternal
Can't you see that you're lost?
Can't you see that you're lost without me?

I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart

You wear the crown
From the pinnacle

You wield the scepter
You wear the gown
From the pinnacle

It is a long way down

In your empire
They stare and frown
From the pinnacle
To the pit

It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crown

Cruciger globus
You stand your ground
The orbus figure
What's flat looks round
From the pinnacle
To the pit

It is a long way down

You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You are cast out from the heavens to the ground
Blackened feathers falling down
You will wear your independence like a crown

Black candles burn, all minds aligned

As the parish sighs in smoke
Enters the lady revealed of cloak
To the haunting sound of the monstrance clock
Singing


[Chorus:]
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son

To the sound of the end of day
Mesmerized, the assembled sway
Black candles burn, all minds aligned

Hypnotizing horns of ram
Paralyzing pentagram
And the eerie sound of the monstrance clock
Singing


[Chorus:]
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son
Come together, together as a one
Come together for Lucifer's son
Come together, together as a one
Come together, forever as one

Into the vessel
Of possibilities

Your green muse
The apparatus
For soul mobility
A gateway to secrecy

Spirit, Absinthe
Spirit, Absinthe

Seven seals
Devilish Creatures
Trumpets the end of time

Cloven Hooves
And I save wormwood
Catapult in your mind
Into the jaws of death

Spirit, Absinthe

There's no return
From this excursion
Of possibilities
You're at the seventh gate

&quot;Let none of this earth inherit
This vision of my spirit&quot;

We're standing here by the abyss and the world is in flames.
Two star-crossed lovers reaching out to the beast with many names.

He is
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see.
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite, he's the force that made me be.
He is
Nostro dis pater, nostr' alma mater.
He is.

We're hiding here inside a dream and all our doubts are now destroyed.
The guidance of the morning stars will lead the way into the void.

He is
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see.
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite, he's the force that made me be.
He is
Nostro dis pater, nostr' alma mater.

He is
He's the shining and the light without whom I cannot see.
And he is
Insurrection, he is spite, he's the force that made me be.

And he is
The disobedience that holds us together.
He is
Nostro dis pater, nostr' alma mater.
And we are falling over the precipice.
