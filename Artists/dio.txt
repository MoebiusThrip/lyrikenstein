Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver

Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you

Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away-get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel

Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid

Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver

Help me - save me
I've just crossed the line
Where reason might betray me
Wake me - shake me
Send a message to my brain
Before they take me
How can I get through to you
That wishes just come true
In dreams

Don't go - don't dare
Cause the journey drives you made
Before you get there
Help me - save me
I'll be glad to give you back
The hand you gave me
How can I get through to you
That wishes do come true
In dreams

If I'm a river - then you're the sea
Somewhere you'll find me
Alone and swimming here in ecstasy

If I am silence - you must be scream
But I don't hear you
I'm in a place that I've just never seen before

Don't go - you'll never save me
I've just slapped away
That helping hand you gave me
Don't wake me - Don't shake me
Here's a message from my brain
You'll never take me
How can I get through to you
That wishes do come true in dreams
In my dreams

I am anger
Under pressure
Lost it cages
A prisoner
The first to escape
I am wicked
I am legion
Strength in numbers
A lie
The number is one


[Chorus:]
I - I - I
Everything that I see is for me
Yes, I am giant
I'm a monster
Breaking windows
In houses
Buildings of glass
Rebel rebel
Holy outlaw
Ride together
Don't try it
The power's in one


[Chorus:]
I - I - I
I am standing alone
But I can rock you
I - I - I
On the edge of the blade
But the knife can't cut the hero down
I am virgin
I'm a whore
Giving nothing
The taker
The maker of war
I'll smash your face in
But with a smile
All together
You'll never
Be stronger than me


[Chorus:]
I - I - I
Right here on my own
But I still rock you
I - I - I
Don't follow behind
Just leave me on the outside
I - I - I
I am standing alone
But I can shock you
I - I - I
On the edge of the blade
But no one makes the hero bleed
(No, no, no)
I am hunger
Feed my head
All together
You'll never
Never make the hero bleed
(No, no, no)

He was ready to rock and roll
So ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart
Gets a taste of freedom - you better look out

He was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But I've seen it before
And it can make you crazy
The eyes are what you see

Why are they watching me

She was ready to black and white
The colors were just too bright
She loved to fly
But she hated falling

She was caught in the in-between
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light
But she just got darkness

Just when you think you're free
The eyes are what you see

Why are they watching me
Why do they do the things they do
Why are they watching me
Watching you

If only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friend

Are you ready for rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes
Will it make you crazy - crazy
Crazy

For you this song is called WE ROCK

You watch their faces
And you'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see

They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Just penetrates your mind

Sail on, sing a song, carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same
Just got a different name

Too many voices
All giving choices
If we listen they will say
We can find the way

Sail on, sing a song, carry on
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock!

We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

Watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see

They come for killing
They leave but still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Just penetrates your mind

Sail on, sing a song, carry on
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

Ride out - stand and shout - carry on
Sail on - sing your song - carry on

We Rock
What do you do?
We Rock
We Rock
We Rock

We Rock
We Rock
We Rock
You Rock
You Rock
You Rock
We Rock

Thank you
Thank you
We love you
Goodnight

Looking on the 
[?]
 side
You're waiting for your life to walk away
Writings on a wall
You just dream forever, forever

Face it - it's another day
And it's gonna be the same tomorrow
The sun is gonna go away
So let it shine on - shine on, yeah, yeah

When you move to the rhythm of shadows
You can hide from the heat of the sun
'Cos If you dance to the beat of the darkness
You burn before the fire's begun

Then comes the night
You come alive

With night music
It keeps spinning around my head
Night music
It's all the things that you never said
And anywhere you are
There's night music

So open up your arms
Let the night time in
Say the word and it begins

In the night you're the song and the singer
You can choose what the band's gonna play
Write the words under cover of moonlight, oh
Make some magic with the things that you say
Together we can kill the day

Night music
You're singer and I'm the song
Night music
Where's the place we can belong

Here comes the night
You will survive
Dancing in the moonlight
Makes you feel alive

Open your arms
Let it begin
Just open up the magic
Let the night time in

Tonight we run we can hide in the dark when the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run it's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind 'cause a tear that never dies can only make you blind
You've got to try 'cause the future's never never gonna die
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending it's a truth without a doubt yeah eh
Tonight we run we can hide in the dark 'till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending it's a truth without a doubt
Now love can be a whisper but pain will always shout to you
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart whoa beat your heart

Look away from the sea
I can take you anywhere
Spend a vision with me
A chase with the wind

Move closer to me
I can make you anyone
I think you're ready to see
The gates of Babylon

The power of what has been before
Rises to trap you within
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more
A city of heavenly sin
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
Oh gates of Babylon

You can see but you're blind
Someone turned the sun around
But you can see in your mind
The gates of Babylon

You're riding the endless caravan
Bonded and sold as a slave
A sabre dance removing all the veils
Getting as good as you gave
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away

Look away from the sea
I can take you anywhere
Spend a vision with me
A chase with the wind

Move closer to me
I can make you anyone
I think you're ready to see
The gates of Babylon

The power of what has been before
Rises to trap you within
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more
A city of heavenly sin
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
Black gates of Babylon

The devil is me
And I'm holding the key
To the gates of sweet hell
Babylon

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

Do your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I, we're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah

When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out

There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark, whoa oh oh
