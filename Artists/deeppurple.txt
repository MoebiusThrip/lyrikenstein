smokeonthewater
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deeppurple/smokeonthewater.html

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

blind
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deeppurple/blind.html

I see reflections in the water
Autumn colours, summer's daughter
And as as the year is growing older
I see winter on my shoulder
I stand in the haze
Watching stormy ripples grow on my own
Never knew your needed
Till I found myself standing here alone

And in the water, such a sad face
Slowly drowning, such a sad face
If only I could change the seasons
Like a poet, I've my reasons
It started to snow in the middle of July
Wonder why
Never did understand you
My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky

In the summer days we flew to the sun
On melting wings
But the seasons changed to fast
Leave us all behind
Blind

But then the stone fell on the water
Putting end to summer's daughter
And me, I turn away remembering
All the seasons, such a sad thing
It started to rain in the middle of the sun
Winter's begun

Never did understand you
My sorrow is hanging in the grey sky

In the summer days we flew to the sun
On melting wings
But the seasons changed to fast
Leave us all behind
Blind

shield
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deeppurple/shield.html

Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream
While the children play in the field
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life
But how strong is the shield?
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground
Where sky is forever blue

So let it pass baby now, the slow and riding cloud
Which may take me from you

Many things a man can lose
His self, his rights, his views
But never his heart or his love
So take this hand of mine and climb baby, climb
To the hill up above

Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream
While our children play in the field
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life
And trust in the strength of the shield

So trust in you love, and Lucy of above
And let light pass like a wheel
Don't take the chance of life's hectic dance
Kiss the strength of the shield

The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground
And to his wish he will yield

Fate will have it's word, of course 
[think this line is wrong...]
And time will change its course
And hold the strength of the shield
[end]
loveconquersall
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deeppurple/loveconquersall.html

Feels like the end
When you're closer to losing your dreams
Than losing a friend
Flying blind
I'm shooting into the dark
Who will I find
Oh girl
And if it takes me a lifetime
I swear I'll tear down every wall
Love conquers all

On my way
Tomorrow I rise with the sun
Soon I'll be gone
Words can't say
How the memories of feelings of love
They linger on
Oh girl
And if it takes me forever
I know it's worth every teardrop that falls
Love conquers all

Somewhere there's a place in your heart
Where the wounds never heal
Well you're not alone
That's just how I feel

Love conquers all
This one will last a lifetime
And if love conquers all
This one will last forever

Somebody's shouting
Up at a mountain
Only my own words return
Nobody's up there
It's a deception
When will I ever learn?


[CHORUS:]
I'm alone here
With emptiness eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And whispering pictures of home

Wondering blindly
How can they find me
Maybe they don't even know
My body is shaking
Anticipating
The call of the black footed crow...


[Chorus]

Here in this prison
Of my own making
Year after day I have grown
Into a hero
But there's no worship
Where have they hidden my thrown...


[Chorus]

Light turn the candle
I spark one for me
Let it float on the water
Right down to the sea
You draw back your curtain
A wavy goodbye
Lift up your arms
And look up to the sky
To the sky!

Stop me a candle
And keep it in the light
Thought it pairing window
And I come back tonight
You touch me in the darkness
I send you a sign
A give me your loving
And Ill give you mine

Im maybe leaving
But I wont be gone
Ill be there when you want me
Above and beyond

Youre fading like I tell you
Its all up to you
Ill be there if youll need me
If I get it through
Reached on your settlers
And tomorrow youll find
Your souls had been touched
Are forever entwined

Im maybe leaving
But I wont be gone
Ill be there when you want me
Above and beyond

Yes Im maybe leaving
But not for too long
Ill be there when you want me
Above and beyond

Changes, visible changes
Sky looking so forlorn
It looks like the world's been born
On one more rainy day

Trying to see the sunlight
My heart's crying out loud
I try to see through the clouds
On one more rainy day

One more rainy day
Once again my mind is grey
This is what a rainy day can do
One more rainy day
One more rainy day

Sun starts shining on through
New day a day with you
It's strange what sun can do
On one more rainy day

One more rainy day
Once again my mind is grey
This is what a rainy day can do
One more rainy day
One more rainy day

ladyluck

She was a juke-box dancer
A blue eyed gypsy queen
She always had an answer
For what she'd done
And where she'd been
A feathercane Lady Midnight
For all around to see
She spoke with words of wisdom
And this is what she said to me

Lady luck
C'mon give me what I want
Pull me up
Lady luck
If I see you again
I will call you my friend

I have always been a sinner
But then the lady came along
She stole my heart and turned me 'round
'Till I didn't know right from wrong
She whispered words of kindness
I'd never ever heard before
Golden words and silver tongue
Till I really couldn't take no more

Lady luck
C'mon give me what I want
Pull me up
Lady luck
If I see you again
I will call you my friend
C'mon shake me

Flying through the night in a beat up wagon
A mike stand up my jacksy
Give me a beer and I'll stand on a chair
And slip into something sexy
Black Cat Woolwich, The Tiger's Head
The Cafe des Artistes, The Revolution and the Bag O'
Nails

I'll see you down the Speak'
Your Ma said you slept real good in your food last
nigth
But you couldn't hold it down
And you broke up a damn good fight
Ligging at the Old Marquee, spinning Jack a line
Even he knew better than me, back in sixty nine

Sixty nine, sixty nine
Sixty nine, sixty nine

On the road to Paradiso
Back of your head, got to pay some dues
Rugged looked down as the Thames swallowed
His life at the Boathouse, Kew
Hot girls, no AC, cheap TV, sleep on the floor
Hallelujah what's a roadie, hush my baby sleep no
more

I was driving through the night

Into an endless tunnel of fog

When it dawned on me something was wrong

I was in a trance, hypnotized


Bored beyond belief, I was listening to the same old song

I know every lick, every word every nuance

I'm on first name terms with the crew

But I'd better get used to this poop du jour

Sure as hell they won't play anything new


Oh yes, I love you really

Classic Rock Radio

Oh, my dear it's time for bed

Time for you to go

Everyone is asleep


The pirates took to the water stole the charts

But sadly that didn't go down well with those upstairs

Who require loyalty, the establishment considered

That the uncontrolled appreciation of music


Was a danger to royalty, the mighty empire roared

As Cash 'n' Everitt on the high seas

Looked like they'd get blown out of the water

They did of course eventually come ashore

As meek as mice or to be more accurate as lambs to the slaughter


Oh yes, I love you really

I stand to attention

Oh, Fanny, I love you dearly

Something else I should mention?

You sweet thing


Let's not talk about MTV

I don't even want to start

I want to take a look at Classic Rock Radio

We're talking about the state of the art


Mr Grover 'n' Mr Gillian

You musta made a million

The night that Frank Zappa caught on fire

Could you tell us all about it


Keep it short and use my version

Or everyone out there'll think I'm a liar

We can speak about bananas for one second


Just because I understand

You have to get them off your chest

But in the meantime while you're talking

Could you do some more of these here ID's

And then this station might maintain some interest


Oh yes, I love you dearly

But why do you exist?

Oh yes, I love you really

Is there something that I missed?

Comin' out of nowhere
Drivin' like rain
Stormbringer dance
On the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering
Breaking the day
No point running
'Cause it's coming your way

Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's gonna make you bleed

Rainbow shaker
On a stallion twister
Bareback rider
On the eye of the sky
Stormbringer coming down
Meaning to stay
Thunder and lightning
Heading your way

Ride the rainbow
Crack the sky
Stormbringer coming
Time to die
Got to keep running
Stormbringer coming
He's got nothing you need
He's gonna make you bleed

Coming out of nowhere
Drivin' like a-rain
Stormbringer dance
On the thunder again
Dark cloud gathering
Breaking the day
No point running
'Cause it's coming your way

Gotta black breast Chinese eyes
Got an English brain that's gonna make me wise
Got a long story that I wanna tell
To a rhythm that I know so well
Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live
I tried another but she didn't want to know

Take a hold now if you can
Take a lesson from a hard lovin' man
I'm a long way from where I wanna go
Guess I'll stay awhile I really love you so
How's about another sip of all the wine you got
Take a tip from me and give it here I'll drink the lot
I'm not a winey, I'm a puttin' on a show

You really really grab me but I've gotta move
Before they know I'm here and spread the news
Maybe in while when I've moved around
I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds
Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live
I tried another but she didn't want to know
