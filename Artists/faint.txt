You could follow logic 
Or contest it all
The work solution makes the common house a home

The element of progress
That you mention is gone 
It de-evolved to something you were headed toward

As i lay to die the things i think
Did i waste my time, i think i did
I worked for life

All we want are just pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes

Like a cast shadow
Like a fathers dream
Have a cut out son
What's a worse disease
To get that pretty little home

As i lay to die the things i think
I don't want to regret what i did- and work for life

All we want are just pretty little homes 
Our work makes pretty little homes

Agenda suicide
The drones work hard before they die
And give up on pretty little homes

(like a cast shadow)
Our work makes pretty little homes
Our work makes pretty little homes
Agenda suicide, the drones work hard before they die
And give up on pretty little homes

Her brow: pensive
Her knees: away
I stand beside her
But i look straight ahead
And dissolve

Before the night began on Herring Street
A book from school kept me wandering
This may take a while
I might never see this through
And they said that chapter four repeats itself
Along with three so far
Where are you tonight?

It's crowded at the sokol club
And tonight will be the same
I want her walk to scream her confidence above me
I try to hide my thoughts
I stare blankly through her face
This seems so senseless
She sees me breathing
My hands are crippled clay
This could have been different
I hear myself saying again again again

The body dances to the beat
Of the noises from the street
As patterns, grids, and schedules go
We took a subway to the show
So give us this day our daily commute
On the bus in three piece suits
Say goodbye, kiss and ride
On the way to the club, look outside
The movement kills in several ways
Although we see it as delay
The steering wheel, a guillotine
The body dances to the beat
Wife: &quot;Take the subway, fuck the street&quot;
The flesh twists between the gap
And passengers are also trapped
Inertia pushed them all along
But they wont make it to their next stop
Patrons complain about the wait
While the man outside can't feel his legs
Man: &quot;Just pull me out, save my life&quot;
But all the cops can do is phone his wife
She drives as fast as she can
And gets caught up in a traffic jam

I write down my nightmares
Stalk my dreams
Undress my future
Decode my enemies

I give hope my money
But waste my time
Give ghosts attention
When they need denial

Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices

No ghosts to side with
No glyphs to hang
I can't fight the prophet
No one sees him

Stare through these eyelids
Deep mirror gorge
But why the eye the inside the mind to fill the void

Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices

Evil voices
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone

Lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices lie when they say you're alone
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices
Evil voices

Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I got a chain saw motor 
That's filled with rain.  
But when it sings like bach
The eyes all bulge
Then when the pink sun drops
The eyelids fold

While I'm in deep REM sleep
Or twilight zones
I take a freight elevator
And press fast forward
I get to grind these teeth   
And peek thru time
If I could bring things back		
They'd feedback wild
When I saw the future - the geeks were right

Egghead boys 
With thin white legs
They got modified features
And software brains
But that's what the girls like
The geeks were right
When I saw the future - the geeks were right

Predator skills
Chemical wars
Plastic islands at sea
Watch what the humans ruin 
With machines

Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I'm in a chainsaw choir 
In dreams that bend 
To let me cut thru time
And stretch out Bach
I make the dry eyes roll
And wet eyes cross

While I'm in deep REM sleep
Or twilight zones
I take a freight elevator
And press fast forward
So I can grind these teeth   
And peek thru time
If I could bring things back		
They'd feedback wild
And when I saw the future - the geeks were right

Feel the vapor pressure drop
As the dark steam pours out the entrance
Real cold world is swirling into
A club that keeps the real life world out
Where every sense seems deathly weak
From the frozen time you spent in transit
The glass danse world flickers on
And the low end thaws your anxious body

Maybe I feel detached
I may just look too shy
It's a disinterest not
That I'm a timid guy
I call them bodies but
They are attentive too
I feel the social glare
I feel the attitude

Watch as mirrors clear themselves
With the breath of frigid air that eased in
Made up babies all rotate as
A siren spins a beam of amber
Time sliced, beat by beat
In a row, in a club, in a line, in the city
The glass danse world flickers on
Because the cycle happens enough

A baby falls out warm
It's screaming for its life
An infant tries to danse
As it grows up then dies
That's simplified, but
When your complexion dries
You wake up cold and think
You wish it'd been this way

Every time I move I'm in another dimension	
Everything I do changes what I want			
I see a choice I make explode in thousands of pieces  	
Every time I choose I become a shard 

I could take up science 
And study cells of the body
Learn to postpone death 
Under the microscope         
I'll make my own lab coat 				
And built a house in the forest
You and me eating mushrooms together 				
We'll stretch out so long, and hope we don't sever	

FOREVER GROWING CENTIPEDES
FOREVER GROWING CENTIPEDES you and I
FOREVER GROWING CENTIPEDES
Through time     

I could step outside and walk in any direction
Everything I choose erases ghosts of potential 
But it makes some new ghosts that I can fill
I can just choose one 
As far as I can tell  

If I veer off course I'll learn to kick out the habit
If I spin  off track I know that I can change
We could both grow up to be a 150
But for now we are children together 

Every time I move I'm in another dimension	
Everything I do changes what I want			
I see a choice I make explode in thousands of pieces 
Every time I choose I become a choice

FOREVER GROWING CENTIPEDES
FOREVER GROWING CENTIPEDES you and I
FOREVER GROWING CENTIPEDES

Let's build a buckminster dome on an island   
We'll seal ourselves in a timeless web  
If every second we make new futures
We'll see how long we can hide from death

I've been
Typing for hours while he waits
Alone in the bushes
There's a guy on the back lawn
He can look under mats but he won't get in

He scales the walls with almost no sound
I'm sitting dead still with the light on
I'm sending off my resignation
Before he gets to all I got

I've been
Typing for hours while he waits
While he aims
I'm staring at nothing
My frozen joints all broke away
I'm sending off to find them

He scales the walls with almost no sound
I'm sitting dead still with the light on
I'm sending off my resignation
Before he gets to all I got

I see you work at night and are you sexually amused?
What's it like to have a room of guys encircling you?
How she moves and how she walks
They all patiently await
While the heat from in their pockets
Could burn marks into their legs
Without your needs and your support
She'd have a job the same as ours; nothing daring
Would she miss a job that's sexual?

In every city there are dozens
Of these clubs where men can go
Some people need a little challenge
To their fantasies at home
There's a little tiny number on a fold of matches
The ink drips from a little dancer's pen
Everybody wants that fold of matches
To re-inflate their confidence
Hey, it is a job, it pays a lot
Is it disservicing someone?
And is it good to get these men worked up so sexual?

Older dancers gag at what new talent seems to mean
Smaller tits and younger limbs can cause a fit of rivalry
But it is a job, it pays a lot
Is it disservicing someone?
And is it good to get these men worked up so sexual?

Campus is getting bigger
They are working on it all the time
Acting on the TV
I can see their faces
Red alert, the siren's loud
The drafted are all coming back
This job takes dedication

When things start with no beginning
It doesn't mean that they aren't true
As the current through the atlas
Nips the wrist with a fork through it
Half the battles fueled with hate
Many loathsome fights were sacred
Shout the crew who hold their swatches
They paint on the set and cry

Ice is plastic enough to try to sculpt with it
The color curdles and waves drip down
And I'm still thinking about the time a scene takes them
The dormitories are awful quiet

Acting on the TV
And he's not pretending
I'm convinced that there's not someone else beneath
The pixeled screen
An army edit
The set was finished last

Ice is plastic enough to try to sculpt with it
Color curdles and waves drip down
I'm still thinking about the time a scene takes them
The dormitories are awful quiet

And these swollen eyes
And static lens
They blink when there's nothing but TV
We beg for it
To calm us down
And believe that it's real what they're doing
These swollen eyes
And static lenses
They blink on and off and off and on

There's a fire in the road where a frame is burnt
And other automobiles are slowing down around the fire
Lanes are backed up and people get all anxious inside
They've got a schedule to keep and don't want life to slip by

The siren and cube are coming up from behind
1981 stereo is drowned from the sound
I see a car with an urge and a driver to control it
He's carried away because what he does is more important

Cars pass in cold blood
I hold back, it's hard to
Because I really want to block
But realize it's a bad time for that

I try to stay calm and watch the ambulance pass
But as the car with the schedule pulled out of their lane
I had a terrible urge, but no driver to control it
Don't get carried away, what he does is not important

Cars pass in cold blood
I hold back, it's hard to
Because I really want to block
But realize it's a bad time for that

Scarlet boots, the kiss of death
Patience and the end of it
Blended angels, whispered love
Countdown 'til it's gone, for long
Velvet voices, haunting slow
Darkened nooks, with bright decor
Georgian femmes are gone for weeks
Southern belles in london sing

I'm staring down the Eppley gate
Two more days before the plane arrives
And you'll be standing here with your smile
Carving up the lobby seats
Pushing down the caffeine drinks
Checking the arrival screens for yours

A hundred feet above the landing
There's a girl gliding down
She's floating toward me now
Her sleeves are all stretching out
And the jet is following behind

Wake up

London skids a grinding halt
Last night left to spend apart
Your bags are packed but now for home
Stories of the tour unfold
Booking Agents
Broken Nose
Butting heads with creeping dolts
Georgian Femmes are gone for weeks
Southern Belles in London Sing

Southern Belles in London Sing

The news has got me paranoid
Papers and the news reports
Casualties of every war
The anchor people keeping score
The weapons now are chemicals
In water and in air above
In circulating envelopes
In powder through the postal routes

The threat of a disease is here
We nipped it once without a cure
It took forever 'til it stopped
Through mandatory needle shots
They gave us all a little dose
To teach our bodies how to cope
Finally when we had it licked
Some terrorists are back with it

The propaganda's working now
I'm falling for it hook and reel
I'm stocking up on medicine
Buying tape to seal us off in

Paranoia! 

Paranoiattack

Paranoia sinks like a bomb

I've seen you a while now
Long enough to be close
There's some things about you
That I should know, I still don't
With all the questions we didn't ask
Our conversations could never last
Our moments alone were scarce and few
It was just easier to hide the truth

If all of our secrets were exposed
Would we be sharing the same bed?
How about if I broke the silence first
Did I hear what you're thinking in your head?
I need to be talked to
I need to be touched
I need you to hold me
I need to feel love
And if I could open up to you
Maybe I could open you up

But instead I got the phone call
Just thought I'd call to let you know
I want to be alone all night again
The phone call
Just thought I'd call to let you know
I want to be alone all night again

With all of the questions we didn't ask
Our conversations could never last
I need to be talked to
I need to be touched
I need you to hold me
I need to feel love
And if I could open up to you
Maybe you could open up to me
We do all the things that lovers do
I've been meaning to tell you how I feel

But instead I got the phone call
Just thought I'd call to let you know
I want to be alone all night again
The phone call
Just thought I'd call to let you know
I want to be alone all night again
