I wait outside your house

And sing below your window

And I look for the light to show, I know

I know that it will come on, come on, come on

Come on soon


There might be a light

Somewhere in your mind

When you think of you and I

I wait for it to shine

I know it will come on, come on, come on

Come on soon

It will come on, come on soon


And it's just the way things go

When you love someone and they don't know

Sparks and hearts, they have to glow

They just glow, they just glow

You know they just come on, come on, come on, come on

They just come on, come on, come on


There is no delusion, to you I don't exist

I am only shadow

Only a ghost can wait as long as I have for this

And I, I can't wait much longer


'Cause there might be a light

Somewhere in your mind

When you think of you and I

I know there will be a light

It might not burn very strong

But I know it's coming on

It will come on, come on, come on

caughtescape
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jarsofclay/caughtescape.html

I'm not sleeping thoughts I can't shake the God
I hope you can rebuild what I break
I'm losing control I'm finding my end you might think I'm alive if I just pretend

Let's just say it lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaa
Is it better to get caught or to escape?

So give me your hand show me a sign to get past the wreckage I leave behind
I'm eating myself erasing old lines I'm still on the edge of that road a million times (oh oh)

Well let's just say it lalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaa
It's better to get caught than to escape.

I'm not sleeping thoughts I can't shake God
I hope you can rebuild what I break
I'm losing control I'm finding my end you might think I'm alive if I just pretend (oh oh)

Well let's just say it lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaa
It's better to get caught than to escape.

And only grace can fix what hearts can break

lovesongforasavior
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jarsofclay/lovesongforasavior.html

In open fields of wild flowers,

she breathes the air and flies away

She thanks her Jesus for the daises and the roses

in no simple language

Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all

He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens

As close a heartbeat or a song on her lips

Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him

Someday He'll call her and she will come running

and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray,


&quot;I want to fall in love with You&quot;


Sitting silent wearing Sunday best

The sermon echoes through the walls

A great salvation through it calls to the people

who stare into nowhere, and can't feel the chains on their souls


He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens

As close a heartbeat or a song on our lips

Someday we'll trust Him and learn how to see Him

Someday He'll call us and we will come running

and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and we'll pray,


&quot;I want to fall in love with You&quot;


It seems too easy to call you &quot;Savior&quot;,

Not close enough to call you &quot;God&quot;

So as I sit and think of words I can mention

to show my devotion


&quot;I want to fall in love with You&quot;


&quot;my heart beats for You&quot;

portraitofanapology
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jarsofclay/portraitofanapology.html

Look what I've done

This picture I've painted

It looks like my heart

Or what still remains


Convinced of the weight

Your interpretations

Are not what I see

I wish they could be


I remember it much redder

I remember it much brighter


[Chorus:]


Can you stay for a while

Try to imagine this

Could you be for a while

I can't remember it

Could you fall for a while

I can't escape from this


I'll try to explain

The way that the frame

Doesn't quite fit the image

Or surround the edge


It stands on display

What do you see?

Behold all the new grey

What's become of the old me


I remember it much redder

I remember it much brighter


[Chorus]


Calling, crying, ashamed of what I am not

Really failing, falling into this cage and I can't escape

I can't escape


Look what I've done

This picture I've painted

Doesn't quite fit

Or surround the edge

I remember it much redder


[Chorus]


I can't escape, I can't escape, I can't escape

muchafraid
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jarsofclay/muchafraid.html

Empty again

Sunken down so far

So scared to fall

I might not get up again


So I lay at your feet

All my brokenness

I carry all of my burdens to you


[Chorus:]


All of these things

I've held up in vain

No reason nor rhyme

Just the scars that remain

Of all of these things

I'm so much afraid

Scared out of my mind

By the demons I've made

Sweet Jesus, you never ever let me go

Oh, sweet Jesus, never ever let me go


So happy to love

Yet so far to go

You lead me on to where I've never been before


[Chorus]

goodbyegoodnight
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jarsofclay/goodbyegoodnight.html

A flower for your vanity, a penny for your thoughts

About the world's insanity and how we've gotten lost

Strike up the band to play a song as we go waltzing by

And fake a smile as we all say goodbye

Goodbye, oh goodbye


Say a prayer for recognition, kiss the ones you love

Gather up the ammunition, sigh for all the lost

Strike up the band to play a song as we go waltzing by

And fake a smile as we all say goodbye


Raise a glass for ignorance, drink a toast to fear

The beginning of the end has come that's why we all are here

Strike up the band to play a song and try hard not to cry

And fake a smile as we all say goodbye

Goodbye

theseordinarydays
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jarsofclay/theseordinarydays.html

[verse]

Not much for conversation

I still find need to pray

Sometimes I get tired of walking

Through these ordinary days

If nothing else I get to see you

Even if we never speak

The harm of words though sometimes

We don't quite know

What they really mean


[chorus]

I don't know where

I don't know how

I don't know why

But your love can make 

These things better


[verse]

So let me lay down in this field

And stare up at the sky

I hope the days and clouds

Turn into something

As they pass us by

And maybe you could settle

For a skyline faded blue

I hope that you might settle

For this love I have for you


[chorus 3x]


Your love can make these things better

Your love can make these things better

Your love can make these things better
[end]
flood
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jarsofclay/flood.html

Rain, rain on my face

It hasn't stopped raining for days

My world is a flood

Slowly I become one with the mud


[Chorus:]


But if I can't swim after forty days

and my mind is crushed by the thrashing waves

Lift me up so high that I cannot fall

Lift me up

Lift me up - when I'm falling

Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying

Lift me up - I need you to hold me

Lift me up - Keep me from drowning again


Downpour on my soul

Splashing in the ocean, I'm losing control

Dark sky all around

I can't feel my feet touching the ground


[Chorus]


Calm the storms that drench my eyes

Dry the streams still flowing

Cast down all the waves of sin

And guilt that overthrow me


[Chorus]


Lift me up - when I'm falling

Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying

Lift me up - I need you to hold me

Lift me up - Keep me from drowning again
[end]
