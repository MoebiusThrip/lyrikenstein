(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve your conscience overseas
(Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me (oh, oh)

I've had my fun and now it's time to serve your conscience overseas
(Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me (oh, oh)

High on the booze
In a tent
Paved with blood
Nine inch howl
Brave the night
Chopper comin' in, you hope

We would circle and we'd circle and we'd circle to stop and consider and centered on the pavement stacked up all the trucks jacked up and our wheels in slush and orange crush in pocket and all this here county, hell, any county, it's just like heaven here, and I was remembering and I was just in a different county and all then this whirlybird that I headed for I had my goggles pulled off; I knew it all, I knew every back road and every truck stop

(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time to serve your conscience overseas

High on the booze

Paved with blood
Nine inch howl
Brave the night
Chopper comin' in, you hope

Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream

&quot;What's the frequency, Kenneth?&quot; is your Benzedrine, uh-huh
I was brain-dead, locked out, numb, not up to speed
I thought I'd pegged you an idiot's dream
Tunnel vision from the outsider's screen
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh
You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh 

I'd studied your cartoons, radio, music, TV, movies, magazines
Richard said, &quot;Withdrawal in disgust is not the same as apathy&quot;
A smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
You said that irony was the shackles of youth
You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh 

&quot;What's the frequency, Kenneth?&quot; is your Benzedrine, uh-huh
Butterfly decal, rear-view mirror, dogging the scene
You smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
You said that irony was the shackles of youth
You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh 

You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh
I couldn't understand
You said that irony was the shackles of youth, uh-huh
I couldn't understand
You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I couldn't understand
I never understood, don't fuck with me, uh-huh

(&quot;A speed zone up here too&quot;)

I never thought of this as funny
It speaks another world to me
I want to be your Easter bunny
I want to be your Christmas tree.

I'll strip the world that you must live in
of all its godforsaken greed.
I'll ply the tar out of your feathers.
I'll pluck the thorns out of your feet.
you and me.
you and me.

and if I choose your sanctuary
I want to wash you with my hair.
I want to drink of sacred fountains
and find the riches hidden there.

I'll eat the lotus and peyote.
I want to hear the caged bird sing.
I want the secrets of the Temple.
I want the finger with the ring.
you and me.
you and me.
you will see.

that if you make me your religion
I'll give you all the room you need.
I'll be the drawing of your breath.
I'll be the cup if you should bleed.

I'll be the sky above the Ganges
I'll be the vast and stormy sea.
I'll be the lights that guide you inward.
I'll be the visions you will see.

the visions you will see.

you will see.
you will see.
you and me.
you and me.
you and me.

Everybody here

Comes from somewhere

That they would just soon forget

And disguise


At the summer camp where you volunteered

No one saw your face,

No one saw your fear

If that apparition had just appeared

Took you up and away

From this base and sheer


Humiliation.

Of your teenage station.


Nobody cares

No one remembers

And nobody cares


Yeah you cried and you cried

He's alive he's alive

Yeah you cried and cried and you

Cried and you cried


If you call out &quot;safe&quot;

Then I'll stop right away

If the premise buckles

And the ropes start to chafe

The details smart

But the story's the same

You don't have to explain,

You don't have to explain


Humiliation.

Of your teenage station.


Yeah you cried and you cried

He's alive he's alive

Yeah you cried and you cried and you

Cried and you


Realized your fantasies

Are dressed up in travesties

Enjoy yourself with no regrets


Everybody here

Comes from somewhere

That they would just as soon forget

And disguise


Yeah you cried and you cried

He's alive he's alive

Yeah you cried and you cried and you

Cried and you cried


Now there's nothing

Dark and there's nothing weird

Don't be afraid i will hold you near.

From the seance where you first betrayed

An open heart on a darkened stage.


A celebration

Of your teenage station


This

Inexperience, sweet, delirious.

Supernatural, superserious.

Inexperience, sweet, delirious.

Supernatural, superserious,

Wow.
