[Intro-Teddy Riley:]
You may now apply (you may now apply)
Your 3D glasses (your 3D glasses)
As we proceed, prepare for proceed

Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go
Just enough to make your juices flow
Press play, don't stop, rotate, too hot
You feel I'm real
I'm everything you need, so tell me what's the deal

2000 watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload
2000 watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload

3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
Release two or three, when I reach I can go 'til I hit my peak
Compact steel o, chico, D-lo, high post lady
Shorty really want to be there for me

2000 watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload
2000 watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload

We now prepare to take you to the next level (Yeah)

200 volts (Are you ready?)
Voltage high

beatit
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/michaeljackson/beatit.html

They told him, &quot;Don't you ever come around here.
Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear.&quot;
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad


[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it 
[4x]

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad


[Chorus 2x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right


[Chorus 3x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/michaeljackson/mindisthemagic.html

Come in to me
I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets
All mysteries are parted
Life is a mirageghost
Imagination
Pure inspiration called justification

Nothing's impossible
Nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?


[Chorus:]
Siegfried &amp; Roy
You know it's
Siegfried &amp; Roy
So be it
Siegfried &amp; Roy
I'm gonna
Siegfried &amp; Roy

When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind over magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

Move of the head
And I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear
From euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening
Nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real

Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe


[Chorus]

'Cause when it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
(Seeing is believin')
When it's Siegfried &amp; Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true

Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throw over mind


[Chorus x2]

billiejean
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/michaeljackson/billiejean.html

She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, &quot;Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?&quot;
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, &quot;Be careful of what you do.
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts.&quot;
And mother always told me, &quot;A-be careful of who you love,
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth.&quot;

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice.)

She told, &quot;My baby, we'd danced 'til three.&quot;
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine, oh, no
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby

A-people always told me, &quot;Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts.&quot;
(Don't break no heart.)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

No, no, no

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, there's not me, baby.)
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
She says I am the one (No, babe.)
But the kid is not my son, no, no, no

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Don't call me Billie Jean
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover

Looking out
Across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?

Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
Just tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
(Do you really like me to be around?)
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

That way (The way it was.)
That way (The way it was.)

Looking out
Across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
(Just tell me you like me to be around.)
Ooh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do it that way?

If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;

Why, why does he do it that way?
If they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
(Just tell me you like me to be around.)
Ooh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do it that way?

And they say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
Ooh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do it that way?

They say, &quot;Why? Why?&quot;
(Just tell me you like me to be around.)
Why, why does he do it that way?
I like livin' this way

The way
The way

Father comes home from work and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table he says &quot;What's going on&quot;
Mother cries desperately, &quot;Our little baby's gone!&quot;

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wants to be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waiting there
&quot;I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair&quot;
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body, ha girl that will take her far
The police come round the corner, somebody there told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK,?
Are you OK, Annie?

(Annie, are you OK?)
(will you tell us that you're OK)
(there's a sign in the window)
(that he struck you a crescendo Annie)
(he came into your apartment)
(he left the bloodstains on the carpet)
(then you ran into the bedroom)
(you were struck down)
(it was your doom)

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats intimidations

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?

(Annie, are you OK?)

(Annie, are you OK?)
(so, Annie, are you OK?)
(are you OK Annie?)
(you've been hit by)
(you've been struck by
A smooth criminal)

OK, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

Aaow!
(Annie, are you OK?)
I don't know!
(will you tell us, that you're OK)
I don't know!
(there's a sign in the window)
I don't know!
(that he struck you a crescendo Annie)
I don't know!

I don't know why baby!

Dang gone it, baby!

Dang gone it, baby!
(that he struck you a crescendo Annie)
Hoo! hoo!

Hoo! hoo! hoo!

Dang gone it!
(you were struck down)
(it was your doom, Annie!)
Aaow!
