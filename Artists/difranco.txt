ive been wondering what you meant

when you asked do you have a light?

ive been wondering where you went

when you left that party that night

cloud blood sweat smeared on the sky

its dawns roadkill

ive been driving since midnight

and im driving still


stop on the top of the ridge

just to feel the wind on my rand mcnally

then i feel the air grow cold

as i drift to the first blue of the valley

and youre wondering how far down you are on my

call back list

but you dont realize

everytime i find im by a phone the landscape shifts


every other song someones trying to write

angels enter the world

every ace every grace every near miss

every decent kiss by a pretty girl

she was an angel

she looked like an angel

and all of the angels did sing

and the angels were watching

and the angels were listening

and the angels were on hand to stand in for everything


you can call it magic

when a man pulls a rabbit out of a hat

but the reason I dont call you

is cuz I wonder if there isnt a better word than that

and you can call me crazy

but I think youre as lazy as white paint on the wall

and I know youll only speak to me in dial tones

if I call


its been way too long 

since ive been behind the wheel

headlights guiding me right through the dark

I feel

driving, trying hard to resist

sleeps first kiss

everytime I have time to think

I think of this

spider

Work of art
Field of play
Slight of hand

Turn of phrase
Port of call
Dark of night
Fear of tight spaces
Fear of heights

Look out, boyscout
It's a spider
The windows, near us, and you know it's
Inside her house
In sight, flashlight
By your pillow
Only one way for this to go

Ship of fools
Tale of war
Change of heart
Day of show
Flight of stairs
Burden of proof
Murder of crows
Moment of truth

Look out, boyscout
It's a spider
The windows, near us, and you know it's
Inside her house
In sight, flashlight
By your pillow
Only one way for this to go

Back to the grind
Right away
Show of hands
Shades of gray
Twist of fate
Sins of weight
Tears of joy
Death or life

Look out, boyscout
It's a spider
The windows, near us, and you know it's
Inside her house
In sight, flashlight
By your pillow
Only one way for this to go

Look out, boyscout
It's a spider
The windows, near us, and you know it's
Inside her house
In sight, flashlight
By your pillow
Only one way for this to go

goingonce
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/anidifranco/goingonce.html

Going once, going twice

Sold to the girl

Who ignored all the advice

Of all the people who knew better

She just stood there

On the front porch

Waiting for her will

To come and get her


She was packed

She had a suitcase

Full of noble intentions

She had a map

And a straight face

Hell bent on reinvention

And she was ready

For the lonely

She was in it for

It only


Going once, going twice

Down the road less taken

With her diary and her WD40

And her Swiss army knife

And her beer

And there was always

Someone there to say

Why don't you just stay

And hang your hat here


But she was packed

She had a suitcase

Full of bungles and near misses

And she was swinging

Through a jungle

Of last calls and first kisses

And she was learning

About please

About huge humilities


Then one day she looked around her

And everything up til then was showing

And she wondered: how did i get here

Without even knowing where i was going?

Now there's no getting out of this

And there is no going back

And it all seems so odd sometimes

And the odds all seem stacked


Going once, going twice

Sold to the girl

Who ignored all the advice

Of all the people who knew better

She just stood there

On the front porch

Waiting for her will

To come and get her


She was packed

She had a suitcase


She had a map

And a straight face


She was ready

For the lonely


She was in it for

It only

state trooper thinks I drive too fast

pulled me over to tell me so

I say out here on the prarie

any speed is too slow

I miss brooklyn I miss my crew

let's start over

I missed my cue

guess I just forgot

who I was talking to


I should have recognized

that fierce look in his eyes

I've seen it in the mirror

so many times

he's going to put his two cents in

'cause he's got a gun

but I'm gonna put in three

'cause history owes me one


guess I came out here to see some

stuff for myself

I mean, why leave the telling

up to everybody else

this may be god's country

but it's my country too

move over mr. holiness

and let the little people through


thank you for serving and protecting

the likes of me

thank you for the ticket

now can I leave?

you know I have left everywhere

I have ever been

I don't really recommend it

though not like anyone asked me

maybe you and I

will meet again someday

I've been known to

come down this road

call it destiny

and then again

maybe not

I don't know

I want somebody who sees the pointlessness

and still keeps their purpose in mind

I want somebody who has a tortured soul

some of the time

I want somebody who will either put out for me

or put me out of misery

or maybe just put it all to words

and make me say, you know

I never heard it put that way

make me say, what did you just say?

I want somebody who can hold my interest

hold it and never let it fall

someone who can flatten me with a kiss

that hits like a fist

or a sentence, that stops me like a brick wall

because if you hear me talking

listen to what I'm not saying

if you hear me playing guitar

listen to what I'm not playing

and don't ask me to put words

to all the spaces between notes

in fact if you have to ask, forget it

do and you'll regret it

I'm tired of being the interesting one

I'm tired of heving fun for two

just lay yourself on the line

and I might lay myself down by you

but don't sit behind your eyes

and wait for me to surprise you

I want somebody who can make me

scream until it's funny

give me a run for my money

I want someone who can

twist me up in knots

tell me, for the woman who has everything

what have you got?

I want someone who's not afraid of me

or anyone else

in other words I want someone

who's not afraid of themself


do you think I'm asking too much?

I am not a pretty girl

that is not what I do

I ain't no damsel in distess

and I don't need to be rescued

so put me down punk

maybe you'd prefer a maiden fair

isn't there a kitten stuck up a tree somewhere


I am not an angry girl

but it seems like I've got everyone fooled

every time I say something they find hard to hear

they chalk it up to my anger

and never to their own fear

and imagine you're a girl

just trying to finally come clean

knowing full well they'd prefer you

were dirty and smiling


and I am sorry

I am not a maiden fair

and I am not a kitten stuck up a tree somewhere


and generally my generation

wouldn't be caught dead working for the man

and generally I agree with them

trouble is you gotta have youself an alternate plan

and I have earned my disillusionment

I have been working all of my life

and I am a patriot

I have been fighting the good fight

and what if there are no damsels in distress

what if I knew that and I called your bluff?

don't you think every kitten figures out how to get down

whether or not you ever show up


I am not a pretty girl

I don't want to be a pretty girl

no I want to be more than a pretty girl
