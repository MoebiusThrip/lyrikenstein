All I can say you know my life it's pretty plain

And all that I can do, is just pour some tea for two

And speak my point of view, but it's not sane

No it's not sane

It's not sane


And I don't understand why I sleep all God damn day

All that I do, is read a book to stay awake

It rips my life away

And it rips my life away

And it will rip your life away

All I can say
Is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
And all I can do
Is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane,
It's not sane

I just want some one to say to me,
&quot;I'll always be there when you wake.&quot;
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain
That there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away,
But it's a great escape
Escape... escape... escape...

All I can say
Is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view
You think that I'm insane
It's not sane... it's not sane.

I just want some one to say to me,
&quot;I'll always be there when you wake.&quot;
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I'll have it made
And I'll have it made
And I'll have it made oh no no no
You know I'm really gonna
Really gonna
Have it made
And I'll have it made
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

soakthesin

I've got to buy some shoes
These ones are getting lose
My feet are shrinking in the 
Sun, and it ain't fun
But it looks like rain up ahead 
In forty miles.
A big rainbow took the blue sky.

I'm gonna tell my momma, I love 
Her so and thank you for 
Giving me these bones o gold
I'm gonna run from my home
Jump in the river and let the
Water soak the sin in my soul.

Fine time we all crossed lines
make the music that makes us 
Feel fine
Rednecks on sun decks hearing a 
Hillside Romeo say &quot;Boys this is the 
Good shit, so come on all and eat 
A little bit.&quot;

And if I ever go back home I'm 
Gonna sell
And tell my momma, I love
Her so and thank you for 
Giving me these bones o gold
I'm gonna run from my home
Jump in the river and let the 
Water soak the sin in my soul.

Don't even say a word, it confuses me
What he says to do, is that we don't 
Have to
We don't have to.

Big stretch and not much sleep
I got a couple of plam trees on each side of my cheek
And it's a bright blue Saturday
And the rummage sells the rubbish to me

But if I could buy the sky that's hangin'
Over this bed of mine
If I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'

If you were standing on the corner staring straight
Into the eyes of Jesus Christ

One porch, one dog, one cockroach only way to be
I got sewage fruit and it's growing out back from roots
I don't know if they belong to me
But if I could buy the sky that's hangin'

Over this bed of mine
And if I could climb these vines
and maybe see what you're seein'

Sittin' at the edge of this building,
Twenty stories below,
A' twenty stories below
Twenty stories below
Twenty stories below

I can't tell you how many ways that I've sat,
And viewed my life today, but I can tell you
I don't think that I can find easier way
So if I see you walking hand in hand in hand
With a three armed man, you know I'll understand

(Pockets full of crappiness
Can't piece together my day
So I pose myself this question
Maybe sleeps gonna get me in the shade
I got my head buried in this pillow
I got my head buried in this pillow
So low...)

But you should have been in my shoes yesterday
You should have been in my shoes yesterday

Come now and listen babe
I gotta reason why I behave
Like a child with a light in eyes
Running naked on a cold winter night
I am like a pigeon that is spreading
it's wings to fly away to better things
Like a hammer that has made
a dent in every little single cent you've spent

Said oh God you've got to help me a little bit
you've got to have a relief file for me

Now I know I'm always right, that's a
thought that never even crossed my mind
Don't touch me there, I've gotta be pure
So smack that hand, and read this verse
So I wrecked your life, what the heck
My new found faith will pay by check
This life's took a toll on my soul

So this is me and that's my song
And I guess that you can see that we don't get along
I've shut the doors on what we had
so now she can sleep with her Dear ol' Dad
my eyes are dry and my hands are clean
and I can't believe all the things I've seen


[Chorus]

Oh My God!
[end]
drive
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blindmelon/drive.html

His feet are dirty
And his face, his face is long
And while he's peeking out
Through his hair he hides the pain
Till that Lennon song comes along
He'll turn it off and say can you drive?

Jimmy, we need to borrow this for a minute
Cause we need to escape

Now there's so many things that
He's gonna do in 5 lifetimes
Hell I could do 'em all
Yeah and while he's rolling his own smokes
He says to me he's buying a new ride today
A classic deal the boss will give
He said the same thing two weeks ago

You've seen that sweaty jet rag
Feeling come over him, and I've
Seen that boy nod into a dream a time or two
And on his way out his glazed stare
Will make you stop and wonder
Hey William is that the last time
I'm gonna look at you?

But the next day phone will ring
And it will be him
Can you drive?
Jimmy, what would you say
what would you do
Oh should I pray?
Or do you think that this blind mind
would listen to me, anyway
[end]
holyman
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blindmelon/holyman.html

I was born on the banks off a hot muddy river
The child of one stupid steamy night
Born to roam beneath the sun
What do you think of me, I'm better left alone

I met a Holyman that said that he knew the way
And he'd like to show me so my life won't go astray
Take my hand child now little boy don't you be afraid
I'll take your soul and walk on water

Holyman, ya don't understand
The cuts on me they run much deeper
Holyman, you righteous man
I've been shown the way a thousand times
Not one a keeper
Older man he said I'll tell you boy
You've planted rotten seeds
And in a land of happiness
They'll grow us evil trees
Guided minds, and eyes that will never see
Holyman I'll tell you
Just what it is that I believe

Holyman I tell you man you gotta
Believe in what you see
Cause its you that corrupt us man and
Deep throat philosophy
I don't need your spells or the little
Games you try to pull on me
Come to think of it I don't need your religion

Gotta get away
I wish you would understand
Everybody prays
Let me find my own way

Out here in nothin' engulfed by the sea
And there's no one here 'cept these fishes and me
I think I could die here
Then I'm hit, leveled hard by the rising tide

Oh, I'm hit hard by the tide,
I'm just livid,
All alone

Sunny, so funny, not funny to me because,
I'm bearing the scars from it burning on me
But I feel so revived, just sittin', here thinkin'
Then I'm hit hard, really hard by the tide

I'm hit hard by the tide, I'm just livid
And I'm livin'

Yeah, I'm hit hard by the tide
I'm livid, livid
Hard by the tide I'm livin'

Underlying

Oh, so more important here

Any kind

Oh, what ever shakes a thrill

Mark my face

The air is really heavy now

I pledge allegiance

So God why don't you come on over here


D - I - E - D

Oh, that's what has happened to you

G - R - E - E - D

Well, there is nothing more to take

Pour the red wine

Watch the news, maybe ventilate

I pledge allegiance

So laddy why don't you come on over here


Letters from the porcupine

They'll stick straight through you

So read one anytime

You think you've made mistakes

Now we'll wait for later

Maybe the next in line will be

Someone who's Daddy's blood

Ran out next to Bush and it be him
