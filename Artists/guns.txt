welcometothejungle

Welcome to the jungle
We've got fun 'n' games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey,
We got your disease


[Chorus:]
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl
That's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here everyday
Ya learn ta live like an animal
In the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me


[Chorus:]
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
I'm gonna watch you bleed

And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down, so down, down, yeah!

You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your...

It's gonna bring you down
Ha!

Half the time they're bedouins

Nomads and/or Aryans

You'll never take me


Oh, my salvation

Oh, my frustrations

Caught in the lies

No one I love is there

Somewhere in time

People will like me there


Oh, sweet salvation

Oh, my frustrations

Caught in the lies

If you ignore this world

Somewhere in time

When will I, get there?

sweetchildomine
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gunsnroses/sweetchildomine.html

She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by


[3x]
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine


[4x]
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Sweet child o' mine

Oh baby, pretty baby

Oh honey, you let me down honey

I ain't playin' childhood games

no more

I said it's time for me

to even the score

So stake your claim,

your claim to fame

But baby call another neme

When you feel the fire,

and taste the flame


Back off, back off bitch

Down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch

You better back off, back off bitch

Face of an angel with the love of a witch

Back off, back off bitch

Back off, back off bitch


Makin' love

Cheap heartbreaker, broken backed,

Nasty ballbreaker, stay out of my bed, outta my head

If it's lovin' you,

I'm better off dead


Back off, back off bitch

Down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch

You better back off, back off bitch

Face of an angel with the love of a witch

Back off, back off bitch

Back off, back off bitch


Emotions ripped, gone on a binge

Life lipped, I said you're off the hinge

Tellin' lies of such fame and glory

I don't even wanna hear your story


Back off, back off bitch

Down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch

You better back off, back off bitch

Face of an angel with the love of a witch

Back off, back off bitch

It's such a pity that you're such a bitch


Back off, back off bitch

It's time to burn-burn the witch

Back off, back off bitch

Back off, back off bitch

Back off, back off bitch

Bitch

Bitch

Bitch

Bitch

Hey wha'd'ya think he's tryin' to say there, anyway?

I think it's something each person's s'posed to take in their own special 

way

Fucking bitch

It don't really matter

Gonna find out for yourself

No it don't really matter

You're gonna leave this thing to

Somebody else


If they were missionaries

Real time visionaries

Sitting in a Chinese stew

To view my dis-infatu-ation

I know that I'm a classic case

Watch my disenchanted face

Blame it on the Falun Gong*

They've seen the end and you can't hold on now


Cause it would take a lot more hate than you

To win the fascination

Even with an iron fist

All they got to rule the nation

But all I got is precious time


It don't really matter

You're gonna find out for yourself

No it don't really matter

So you can hear now from

Somebody else


Cause it would take a lot more time than you

I've got more masturbation

Even with your iron fist

All they got to rule the nation but all I got is

Precious time

All they got to rule the nation but all I got is

Precious time


It don't really matter

I guess you'll find out for yourself

No it don't really matter

So you can hear it now from

Somebody else


You think you got it all locked up inside

And if you beat them all up they'll die

Then you'll walk them home for the cells

Then now you'll dig for your road back to hell

And with your ? makes you stop

As if your eyes were their eyes you can tell

And you're out of time

I don't have plans and schemes

And I don't have hopes and dreams

I, I, I don't have anything

Since I don't have you


And I don't have fond desires

And I don't have happy hours

I don't have anything

Since I don't have you


Happiness and I guess

I never will again

When you walked out on me

In walked ol' misery

And she's been here since then


[spoken]
 Yeah, we're fucked!


I don't have love to share

And I don't have one who cares

I don't have anything

Since I don't have you


You, you, you, oh, oh!

You, you, you, oh, oh!
