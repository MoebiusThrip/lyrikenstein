Go find your place of worship
Look into your pain and find your praise
Every low place in your life
Prepared you for your hard place
Every tear you cried is water for
The garden of your victory

And even though you're in the valley,
Victory comes through your adversity
Go find your place of worship

Go find your place of worship
Look into your pain and find your praise
Every low place in your life
Prepared you for your hard place and
Every tear you cried is water for
The garden of your victory


[x3]
And even though you're in the valley,
Victory comes through your adversity

Go find your place of worship

Worship, I found my mine
Now I can say: Holy, Holy
Holy is the Lamb


[x7]
Righteous

Righteous is the Lamb

He's lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, my God is lovely,
Lovely is the Lamb

In Your presence there is fullness of joy,
At His right hand, there are pleasures ever more;
As we dwell within your gates,
Your holy name we celebrate!

I was glad when, they said unto me,
Come and dwell, in that place where You will be;
As we stand on holy ground,
And with the angels we resound!

There is joy in Your presence,
Peace in Your presence; 
That's where I want to be say,
That's where I want to be 
[x2]

So I will enter into Your gates with thanksgiving,
In Your courts, I will lift my hands and sing;
We will bless Your holy name,
Your greatness we proclaim!

I will sing unto You a brand new song,
Shout with triumph and dance before Your throne;
Rejoice in You always,
You are the strength of all my days!

For I found out,

There is joy in Your presence,
Peace in Your presence; 
That's where I want to be say,
That's where I want to be 
[x4]

I know there's healing, right there,
And deliverance, right there;
And that is where I want to be
And that is where I want to be 
[x2]

In your presence 
[x4]

Right there 
[x4]

[Chorus:]

Do you know Him?

Do you know Him? 

Do you know Him, do ya do ya?


[Verse 1:]

He rolled the stone away and He rose again to give me another chance;

turned water into wine, preached from sea to sea, 

saved three brothers from the fire, and delivered me.

Tell me who is this man that makes the minimum waves obey His command;

some say Elijah, some say a prophet, some say a teacher,

tell me do you know who He is?


[Bridge 1:]

People talking, people always talking, 

everybody's talking 'bout a new thang; 

don't we know that Jesus is the real thang?

Do you know it, you know it, you know it, you know? 

Get up.

Get up.


[Verse 2:]

He stepped out of eternity into time 

and to seal on my behalf and to redeem lost man.

He spoke and it was, He created dust, 

by the power of His voice, here's the keys to your life.


[Bridge 2:]

People talking, people always talking, 

everybody's talking 'bout a new thang; 

don't we know that Jesus is the real thang?

Do you know it, you know it, you know it, you know?

unworthy
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marvinsapp/unworthy.html

I'm so unworthy Lord
You gave me life and life more abundantly
Filled me with song,
Gave me strength to go on
How unworthy Lord I am

You bring laughter in sorrow,
Hope for tomorrow
My peace in the midst of my storm
You're my doctor in sickness
And I'm gonna be Your witness
Show me Your will from wrong
You're like the potter with clay,
Please mold me I pray
I want to be used as Your own

Filled me with song, gave me strength to go on
How unworthy Lord I am

I've been made worthy Lord,
Since You put Your hands on me
I've been made worthy Lord,
Your love has set me free

I lift my hands to You
For You've been so kind and true
All the praises, it belongs to You
Oh my Lord, yes it does

I worship You, Almighty God,
There is none like You.
I worship You, oh Prince of Peace,
That is what I long to do.
I give you praise, for You are my righteousness.
I worship You, Almighty God;
There is none like You.


[There Is None Like You:]


[Chorus:]
There is none like You,
No one else can touch
My heart like You do.
I could search for all eternity long and find, there is none like You.

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
(Public Domain)

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
There's just something about that name
Master, Savior, Jesus
Like the fragrance after the rain
Kings and Kingdoms
Shall all pass away
There's just something about that name

Lord I know I don't deserve your goodness

All of the love you show me each and every day

Exceeding above all I can ask for

What can I give to you

My heart my life and all my praise


[Chorus:]

I wanna give you more and more

And more and so much more

You keep giving and never take away

I wanna give you more and more

And more and so much more

All I have is yours for the rest of my days


Your blessings are always overwhelming

I could never give you more than you give me

But there's one thing that

I can give back to you

I'll worship you only, throughout eternity


[Chorus]


What can I do for you

What can I be for you

What can I give to you

What shall I render
