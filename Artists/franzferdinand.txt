takemeout
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franzferdinand/takemeout.html

So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot, then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say don't you know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out!

I say you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say... take me out!

I say you don't know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out!

If I move this could die
If eyes move this could die
I want you...to take me out!

I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say take me out

If I wane, this could die
I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out

If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

briefencounters
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franzferdinand/briefencounters.html

We are bored
We are married
We are young
On the edge of the city
The edge of Ambrosia
Rolls upon rolls upon
Rolls upon the tongue

A certain party
A certain cul-de-sac
A certain outcome
A certain piece of me

Car keys choose your keys

Outside alone
Crossing a perfect lawn
Could it be you
Could it be you
Or could it be
This is what freedom is?

We are brief encounters
We all lose our keys
We all choose our partners
We all choose our keys
Car keys choose your keys

Pull back
Pull back
Into the drive
Rigid in the matrimonial superking bed
Pretend to sleep
Pretend to sleep
Come on pretend
Yeah, lets pretend

We are brief encounters...

rightaction
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franzferdinand/rightaction.html

Come home practically all is nearly forgiven
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Almost everything could be forgotten
Right thoughts, right words, right action


[Chorus:]
But how can we leave you
To a Saturday night or a Sunday morning
Good morning

Sometimes I wish you were here, weather permitting
Right thoughts, right words, right action
This time, same as before, I'll love you forever
Right thoughts, right words, right action


[Chorus]

11 South Court Gardens
England's Lane past end to London


[Outro:]
Sometimes I wish you were here, weather permitting
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Right thoughts, right words, right action...

Hey friends when will you get here?
Hey friends I need to hear voices
I don't care what you talk about
Hey friends I just need to hear voices
Could you bring the manual
Bring the repair manual
Something has really gone wrong here

I'm the king of the animals
I'm the king of the trees and animals
Self-crowned king of the trees and the animals
I'm a king so give me a crown
I am an animal
Give me an animal crown

Hey friends when will you get here?
Hey friends this is my kingdom
This is a tree
This is an animal
Ask any one of them
And they daren't deny it
Ask any one of them
And they daren't deny it
No don't you dare deny it
This is my tree
This is my animal
But something has really gone wrong

I'm the king of the animals...

I am an animal, oh give me an animal crown (x infinity)
I'm in love with a narcissist - I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my nemesis - I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with a narcissist - I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my pharmacist - I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with a narcissist - I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my analyst - I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my nemesis - I know for the mirror told me

Hey friends when will you get here?
Hey friends I need to hear voices
I don't care what you talk about
Hey friends I just need to hear voices
Something has really gone wrong

He's a demagogue
Check out his rise
He's a demagogue
He's fatally famous
He's a demagogue
He plays with my fears
A demagogue
My shadow side dreaming
The demagogue
It feels so good to be dumb

From the Wall straight to La Quenta
Those pussy grabbing fingers won't let go of me now

A demagogue
A demagogue

He's a demagogue
He'd like to punch in your face
He's a demagogue
Throwing terminal shade
The demagogue
He knows all of the words
He's a demagogue
He sees a nation of marks

From the mob to chapter eleven
Those tiny vulgar fingers on the nuclear bomb

A demagogue
A demagogue

What's a mother and father got to do with making me?
What's a mother and father got to do with making me?
What's a mother and father got to do with making me?
What's a mother and father meant to do with making me?
What's a mother and father meant to do with making me?
What's a mother and father meant to do with making me?
What's a mother and father meant to do with making me?

Love love
Love is going to come as a photographer
As a photographer, yeah yeah
I need love to someone better bring me a photographer
As a photographer, yeah

A flash
A glimpse of perfect abs
In flimsy floral dress
Shows off her slender frame
Enjoys a private stroll

Love love
Love is going to come as a photographer
As a photographer, yeah yeah

Off duty beauty
Keeping it real
Shows off
All her features
Grabs a bite to eat

Stepping out
Sports a bruise on her neck
As she's heading to
To the studio

Decadent
No, she's never been shy
No she's never, never
Never been shy

Love love
Love is going to come as a photographer
As a photographer, yeah yeah
I need love to someone better bring me a photographer
As a photographer, yeah yeah

Bring me just a glimpse of love
Just a glimpse of love

Just a glimpse of love
Just a glimpse of love

jacqueline
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franzferdinand/jacqueline.html

Jacqueline was seventeen

Working on a desk

When Ivor

Peered above a spectacle

Forgot that he had wrecked a girl

Sometimes these eyes

Forget the face they're peering from

When the face they peer upon

Well, you know

That face as i do

And how in the return of tha gaze

She can return you the face

That you are staring from


It's always better on holiday

So much better on holiday

That's why we only work when

We need the money


Gregor was down again

Said come on, kick me again

Said i'm so drunk

I don't mind if you kill me

Come on you gutless

I'm alive

I'm alive

I'm alive

And how i know it

But for chips and for freedom

I could die


It's always better on holiday...
