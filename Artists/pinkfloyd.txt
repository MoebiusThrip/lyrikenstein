Far, far, far away - way

People heard him say - say

I will find a way - way

There will come a day - day

Something will be done.

Then at last the mighty ship

Descending on a point of flame

Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall


Now, now, now is the time - time

Time to be - be - be aware

Carter's father saw him there

and knew the Rhull revealed to him

the glowing soul of Hereward The Wake.


Oh, my, something in my eye - eye

Something in the sky - sky

Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolls slowly back

The service men were heard to sigh

For there revealed in glowing robes

Was Lucy in the sky


Oh - oh - did you ever know - know

Never ever will they

I cannot say

Summoning his cosmic powers

And glowing slightly from his toes

The psychic emanations fly

Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men

Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do

&quot;Forward!&quot; he cried
From the rear
And the front rank died
And the General sat
As the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who?

Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round and round

&quot;Haven't you heard
It's a battle of words?&quot;
The poster bearer cried.
&quot;Listen, son,&quot;
Said the man with the gun,
&quot;There's room for you inside.&quot;

&quot;Well, I mean, they're gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh...short, sharp shock, they don't do it again.
Dig it? I mean he got off light, 'cause I could've given 'I'm a thrashin' but I only hit him once.
It's only the difference between right and wrong innit? I mean good manners don't cost nothing, do they? Eh?&quot;

Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about

With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?

Get out of the way,
It's a busy day
And I've got things on my mind
For want of the price
Of tea and a slice
The old man died

I am just a new boy 

A stranger in this town 

Where are all the good times 

Who's gonna show this stranger around? 

Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 

Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl 

Will some woman in this desert land 

Make me feel like a real man 

Take this rock and roll refugee 

Oooh Babe set me free 

Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 

Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl. 

Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 

Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.

money
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/money.html

Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the hi-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away

&quot;HuHuh! I was in the right!&quot;
&quot;Yes, absolutely in the right!&quot;
&quot;I certainly was in the right!&quot;
&quot;You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!&quot;
&quot;Yeah!&quot;
&quot;Why does anyone do anything?&quot;
&quot;I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!&quot;
&quot;I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He was asking why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely.
It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out.&quot;

[Childs voice:]

Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.


Oooooooo ooo ooo ooooh 

Did you see the frightened ones 

Did you hear the falling bombs 

Did you ever wonder 

Why we had to run for shelter 

When the promise of a brave new world 

Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky 

Oooooooo ooo ooooo oooh 

Did you see the frightened ones 

Did you hear the falling bombs 

The flames are all long gone 

But the pain lingers on 

Goodbye blue sky 

Goodbye blue sky 

Goodbye 

Goodbye

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here

And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear

That I'm not here.

And I never knew the moon could be so big

And I never knew the moon could be so blue

And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes

And brought me here instead dressed in red

And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.

I don't care if the sun don't shine

And I don't care if nothing is mine

And I don't care if I'm nervous with you

I'll do my loving in the winter.

And the sea isn't green

And I love the queen

And what exactly is a dream

And what exactly is a joke.

twosunsinthesunset
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/twosunsinthesunset.html

in my rear view mirror the sun is going down

sinking behind bridges in the road

and i think of all the good things

that we have left undone

and i suffer premonitions

confirm suspicions

of the holocaust to come

the rusty wire that holds the cork

that keeps the anger in

gives way

and suddenly it's day again

the sun is in the east

even though the day is done

two suns in the sunset

hmmmmmmmmm

could be the human race is run

like the moment when your brakes lock

and you slide toward the big truck

and stretch the frozen moments with your fear

and you'll never hear their voices

and you'll never see their faces

you have no recourse to the law anymore

and as the windshield melts

my tears evaporate

leaving only charcoal to defend

finally i understand

the feelings of the few

ashes and diamonds

foe and friend

we were all equal in the end

Sunlight bright upon my pillow

Lighter than an eiderdown

Will she let the weeping willow

Wind his branches round

Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams

Every night I turn the light out


Waiting for the velvet bride

Will the scaly armadillo

Find me where I'm hiding

Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams

Will the misty master break me

Will the key unlock my mind

Will the following footsteps catch me

Am I really dying

Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams

Lucifer Sam, siam cat.

Always sitting by your side

Always by your side.

That cat's something I can't explain.

Ginger, ginger, Jennifer Gentle you're a witch.

You're the left side

He's the right side.

Oh, no!

That cat's something I can't explain.

Lucifer go to sea.

Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.

Somewhere, anywhere.

That cat's something I can't explain.

At night prowling sifting sand.

Hiding around on the ground.

He'll be found when you're around.

That cat's something I can't explain.

So ya
Thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel

And they sent us along as a surrogate band
And we're going to find out where you fans really stand

Are there any queers in the theatre tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall (against the wall)!
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get 'em up against the wall (against the wall)!

That one looks Jewish and that one's a coon
Who let all this riff raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way I'd have all of you shot

childhoodsend
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/childhoodsend.html

You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest if once put to the test?
You awake with a start to just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

You set sail across the sea of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood's end
Your fantasies merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
All the fears never voiced say you have to make your final choice

Who are you and who am I to say we know the reason why?
Some are born
Some men die beneath one infinite sky
There'll be war, there'll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend
So this song will end

bike
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/bike.html

I've got a bike. You can ride it if you like.

It's got a basket, a bell that rings and

Things to make it look good.

I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.

I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a cloak. It's a bit of a joke.

There's a tear up the front. It's red and black.

I've had it for months.

If you think it could look good, then I guess it should.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.

I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house.

I don't know why. I call him Gerald.

He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.

I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I've got a clan of gingerbread men.

Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men.

Take a couple if you wish. They're on the dish.

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world.

I'll give you anything, ev'rything if you want things.

I know a room of musical tunes.

Some rhyme, some ching. Most of them are clockwork.

Let's go into the other room and make them work.

seabirds
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/seabirds.html

Mighty waves come crashing down, 

The spray is lashing high into the eagle's eye 

Shrieking as it cuts the devil wind, 

is calling sailors to the deep 

But I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear 

Surf is high an' the sea is awash 

An' a haze of candy floss, glitter and beads 

Rock that we sat on and watched in the sun 

That was hot to touch 

And the sea was emerald green 

I can hear the sound of seabirds in my ear 

And I can see you smile 

Surf comes rushing up the beach 

Now will it reach the castle wall and will it fall

Catfish dappled silver flashing 

Dogfish puffing bubbles in my deep

Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew.
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground.
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania.
Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten.
Blinding signs flap,
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow.
Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds around
The icy waters underground.

if
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/if.html

If I were a swan, I'd be gone.
If I were a train, I'd be late.
And if I were a good man, I'd talk with you more often than I do.
If I were to sleep, I could dream.
If I were afraid, I could hide.
If I go insane, please don't put your wires in my brain.
If I were the moon, I'd be cool.
If I were a rule, I would bend.
If I were a good man, I'd understand the spaces between friends.
If I were alone, I would cry.
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry.
And if I go insane, will you still let me join in with the game?
If I were a swan, I'd be gone.
If I were a train, I'd be late again.
If I were a good man, I'd talk to you more often than I do.

time
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/time.html

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

Hello,
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone at home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go.

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb.
