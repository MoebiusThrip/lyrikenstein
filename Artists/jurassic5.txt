[Marc 7]
Syllable slasher, insurmountable mic gasher
Quick to vent with intent, you can't crash us
Constant link passers, styles'll skate past ya
Beats that we present will make you hate like a slave master (Hardcore)
Heated and hot, control the venomous plots
We be the cream of the crop, so keep our name out your mouth
We'll entertain your brain for three minutes and change
Ain't it strange, your fame is three minutes and change
Let me finish explainin', break it down like a layman
All the stuff that you sayin', Ain't it all entertainin'


[Akil]
Uhh, Yea...
(Red hot) molten lava
Too hot for toddlers
Too hot for you and your crew so don't bother
I'm the globetrotter, party block rocker
Heart and show stopper, break it off proper


[Soup]
With lengths to go,Yo
The Jacques Cousteau with flow, and underground continental
With words that blow
The competitions straight to the door
We'll rock it, Herbie Hancock it like '84, Fo' sho'


[Jurassic 5]
This jam is red hot


[Chali 2na]
A smooth brotha, for real we buckshots like that BlackMoon fella
The backroom sellers makin' rap tunes illa
The Killa flow spilla, the Chicago killa named 2na


[Marc 7]

We movin' in tandem, your crew couldn't phathom
We reppin' the fashion, no mushin' and mashin'
I'm through with you has beens
Your crew better cash in


[Jurassic 5]
This jam is red hot, when were rockin the spot
If you like it or not, this jam is red hoooooot


[Soup]
The vangard of art
Quick to put pen to the thought
And nice from the minute I start, huh
Maneuver well, I tell girls that can't tell
That say since I don't look like Maxwell
They think I can't mack well


[Chali 2na]
We them backpack boys, at your backdoor
They can catch a cap like a hatch door
Givin' the exact score
Forever we fight for honor yo
Tight since we was lable mates with Mic Geronimoooo!


[Marc 7]
Walking, stompin' in my big black boots
It be the crew J5 and we're all in cahoots
(Soon) to bring it to ya live, yea that's what you paid for
With skills much sharper than a Texas Chainsaw


[Akil]
Yo, pipin' hot and your mic is not
We steam from the pot, you wet like rain drops
We fire with the brimstone
Heat up your girls erogenous zones with electrified sparks and poems


[Jurassic 5]
This jam is red hot, when were rockin the spot
If you like it or not, this jam is red hoooooot

This jam is red hot


[Chali 2na]
So let the ash blow
We relieve static with a grammatic fiasco

[Akil]

qualitycontrol
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jurassic5/qualitycontrol.html

[Jurrasic 5 Together]
Ayo my quality control, captivates your party patrol
Your mind, body, and soul
For whom the bell tolls, let the rhythm explode
Big, bad, and bold b-boys of old
Many styles we hold, let the story be told
Whether platinum or gold, we use breath control
So let the beat unfold, intro on drum roll
We be the Lik like E, Tash, and J-Ro
We harass niggas like we was the po-po
We can rule the world without Kurtis and still Blow
Finesse, from SP to Casio
Your jams ain't def, you ain't fresh, you're so-so
If you don't know us by now you'll never know
You set that mood when we groove and prove a show
The name of the game is survive and prove your flow
You can't out take Jurassic syllable
Cause it's survival of professional radio
Stop and comprehend and heed the words of my pen
Survival of professional poetical Highlanders


[Zaakir]
(Soup, you plan on rocking something fierce?) Oh, am I
Zaakir's the name, the A.K.A. super
The verbal acupunture from the dope old schooler
I used to be the brother for others that used to dumb on
Now they be the lovers of brothers that can't front on
Put me in the mix, LP 12-inch
SP, the elegant, poetic pestulence
I'm carbonated, the Fanti-confederated
Highly commemorated, and the most celebrated
For connecting it (Word!) Like verb subject to the predicate
Plus I got the etiquette
To keep it moving, and showing cats how it's done
Cause it's the verbal combat, position number one


[Mark 7even]
We keep it beaming like a beacon, if it's clearance that you're seeking
Whether black or Puerto Rican, people back us when we're speaking
We got the kind of rhymes that get you ready for the weekend
(To the mass amount of legions that came for party pleasing)
Our temperature is freezing all kind of different regions
The rhythm is the reason you're checking for what we've done
Please son, our thesis, will rip your crew in pieces
Your rhymes ain't right, homeboy, you ain't in season


[Jurrasic 5 Together]
Ayo my quality control, captivates your party patrol
Your mind, body, and soul
For whom the bell tolls, let the rhythm explode
Big, bad, and bold b-boys of old


[Charlie 2na]
Yo, yo, well it's the angelic man-relic clan repellent
My plan parent manuscripts withstand bullets
Flashing like a Japan tourist, we command pure hits
While you cramming to understand these contraband lyrics
My fam submits to pray, 5 times a day
Climbing into your mind with live rhyme display
J5 finds a way to remain supreme
Coming verbally Hardison as if my name was Kadeem


[Akil]
Ayo my team Dreamworks without Spielberg or spill words
Communicate from the Earth throughout the universe
I transmit, transcipts, transcontinental lyrics
Deeply rooted in your spirit
Up, I love the power of words, nouns and verbs
The pen and the sword, liquid stick on award
No folklore or myths in my penmanship
The Panther Scholar Warriors is what I present, uh
Verbally decapitating those against a
Jihad-fee-sabeel-illah words make sense
You gots to get up on your vocab, you gots to have vocab
Letters makes words, and sentences makes paragraphs


[Akil]
Yo, I make the pen capsize, the verbal with the planted eyes
Planning knives ever pair that I utilize
Spit juice, crack blood from your tooth
Inflict truths, speak Allah's 99 attributes


[Charlie 2na]
You baby MC's drink Pedialyte
While underground doesn't like you, the media might
But we the elite will change that
As we bridge gaps in this lyrical grudge match, brothers we slug back


[Mark 7even]
Yeah, we bless tracks with the help of a raw rap
Inprinted like poor tracks all over your brain rack
My mental maneuver will clear and steer right through ya
We Grand like Puba, understand that we move ya


[Zaakir]
Ayo, my rhythm reveal rollercoaster real deal
Revolutionize with active build
I plant my dreams in the field and wait to harvest my skills
For the starving MC, hungry trying to get a meal


[Jurrasic 5 Together]
Ayo my quality control, captivates your party patrol
Your mind, body, and soul
For whom the bell tolls, let the rhythm explode
Big, bad, and bold b-boys of old

monkeybars
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jurassic5/monkeybars.html

This record is particulary for then youngsters...
Now you get right to the procedure

Now what do you like the most about this
Conflict, Consequence, constant evidence
A classic contact communicator confrence
Weither 5 or 6 weither a number misprint
Or if it seems that, you heard above 4
If you thought that you would never hear it no more
You should never dial commin runnin murda mile
Cause it's all about ya health (lets go)
(wait wait)
Now you know us but it's not the coke rush
Four MC's so we ain't the furious
Like the fourth mc's or the 3 from trecherous
It's a blast from the past from the moment we bust
But if our shit go rough, still in god we trust
Cause it's the - comming
Display the rhymes so stunning
We keep ya runnin, and give a shoutout to the london
And keep it all, and still perform till the early morn'
Some said till dawn
We got a word abundance, hold benz by the hundreds
Top speed, guarenteed, we stil runnin

People master my tere-tactics
Why you actin plastic
Treatin all ya fans like ya matches
We be the other pair comin' in tight the tupper wear
Other fear, push ya luck and beware the brigadier

Yo, DJs be spinnin the records that make up the music
So people can focus whenever the mic has been passed to me

The more drums we have in our kit, the more we can handle
We gonna take a break here..

Lets go. wait wait still

Jump a bill A-K-I-L known to exhale when i inhale
And you can tell when in the coo i do my duty-o
And swung to the studio
J-5 let the beat bounce
Thats what counts without a doubt 
so sup grab the mic and pull the magic out ya mouth
We be the rythem kings, plus the rhyme channelings
(I could sneer anything) Go ahead

Sneer 
[repeated 21 times]

Light emcee kay mastered fatness so we crack this
Runnin through wall and wack this
Yo, 2 emcees add a little um, spice
So we concentrate on mic's and keep the path tight
3 emcees underground and worldwide
Surgean general on the 5 to defy the certified
4 emcees at ya door once more
When it rains in pours from the heavens to the earths floor
Elements, vocal instruments super extra strength
Hip-hop activist
Throw yo mind no time and inner twine
Roll with the rhymes ta let the sun rise
You should know, when we flow, you get what ya lookin for
Terrorize ya enterprise
And we dont shoot until we see the whites in ya eyes

Non-stop, real rhyme rockin
Disc jockeys out record shoppin'
Writers doin graphs so bring ya pop lockin'
We incorporate the whole of hip hoppin', non-stop

Non-stop, we keep it up to par 
from the metal monkey bars to conquer school yards
It's like bein arabic, comin from right to left
It's hot to def so take a breath and (wait wait)


[Applause + Laughter]

Ya. Get the fuck, this fo entertainment
This made to stoppin the day
Pop pop pop...

[Jurassic 5 together]
Ayo, it's like this when Allah says &quot;Let it be like&quot;
We are some designated, poetical brothers with mics
For whoever had skills to possess the gift
Combinated with the flavor and it goes like this...Tuna Fish!


[Chali 2na]
I'm amphibious, citizen with the lesson plan
Cashier at the J5 concession stand (Akil!)


[Akil]
The militant steel with the peripheral
Telegraphic skill bulid up crossfield (Mark 7even!)


[Mark 7even]
Fundamentalist brining my verbal gift
My style is packed Quik like cocca in Swiss Miss (Zaakir!)


[Zaakir]
For the way my pen sticks to rhymes
Cause a million party people, it's about that time


[Jurassic 5]
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drums
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one


[Akil]
I be the spark from the cannon, blaze the outstanding
Tug of war, with the poor, rich, and scandlous
Roadrunning bandit, race against advancment
Style winds cause storms when I perform


[Mark 7even]
I'm a ?Parker John robot? and stomp your whole spot
And beat you whole crew to a bunch of whole knots
Dissect you from the inner then declare myself the winner
Once the style clears, you'll be (real like Finner)


[Chali 2na]
One of the black your contractor
Attacking your backdoor, you're trapped in my trash compactor
Move back, whore, swingings before the trap door
It's causin the capture of brothers who rap more


[Zaakir]
Yeah, check the shelling, rock niggas redder than watermelon
The grief-stricken, rotated 20/20 vision
Rap felon, hottest rebel with bad spelling
I pitch shift with unprecedented sharpness


[Jurassic 5]
Distributor, local street corner contributor
Word inhibitor, scientific positioner
Rhythm commision be J's for real
&quot;He drives the corssfader like a cutmobile&quot;

We prepetrate the fake, the fraud, the phony
Jurassic Masters of the Ceremony
You came and saw right before your eyes
In fact the old school flavor has survived, like this...


[Instrumental breakdown]

And together, we show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drums
We taking four MC's and make 'em sound like one

And together, we show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
So whoever bought the tape bring your butt right back
Cause you never in your life heard a cut like that


[Zaakir]
Hey, we flip fast phonographs 45 records smash
High was the forecast, ain't nothing they never had


[Mark 7even]
Make a move, never lose, competition quick to choose
New styles, hot rhymes, guarenteed to blow your mind


[Chali 2na]
(Who is he?) The subtle fanatic for unity
Demonstratin the ghetto diplomatic immunity


[Akil]
Well I'm the style stimulist, sound photosynthesis
Super with the sentences in the Latin centuries


[Jurassic 5]
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drums
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one

And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic in the place to be
It's the J-U-R-A double S I-C
