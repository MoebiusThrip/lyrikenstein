I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate...

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate...

Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday
I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

freakshow
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cure/freakshow.html

I can't believe it, I must be dreaming

She turns the sound down

Says, &quot;I am heaving

This is a freakshow&quot;


And I am screaming

She spins the world round

I want to stop


Bittersweet again

Her opening move

Down and out in black

Soft shiny and smooth


Looks like the alien

Crowd got groove

She burns her name into my arm

But I can never get through


To play the game

She's trying to lose

Her ultraviolet makes it

Harder to choose


Looks like the edge

Of the earth got moved

She blurs a way across the floor

I spin to swallow the view


And it's the same sway

Yeah, it's the same slide

It's the same stare, oh


It's the same smile

Yeah, it's the same but

It's not quite right


Oh, it's insane

She shakes like a freak

Stuck in the middle

Of the room for a week


Looks like the only way

To get on the beat

Is take her up on how to swing

But I am missing my feet


And it's the same sway

Yeah, it's the same slide

It's the same stare, oh


It's the same smile

Yeah, it's the same but

It's not quite right


I'm in a step, out

She two more steps down

For three steps up, clap

And go around, ow


It makes my head buzz

She wants to come now

I try to stop


Always infra dig her

Finishing move

Up and down in black

Soft shiny and smooth


Looks like the alien

Crowd got groove

She cuts a number out my arm

But I can never get through


To play this game

She's trying to lose

The stuff from Mars

Makes it harder to choose


Looks like the final frontier got moved

She blurs a way across the floor

I spin to swallow the view


And it's the same sway

Yeah, it's the same slide

It's the same strip, oh


It's the same smile

Yeah, it's the same

But it's not quite right


I can't believe it, I must be dreaming

She turns the lights up

Says she is leaving

This is a freakshow


And I am beaten

She spins the world round

Movement
No movement
Just a falling bird
Cold as it hits the bleeding ground
He lived and died
Catch sight
Cover me with earth
Draped in black
Static
White sound

A day without substance
A change of thought
An atmosphere that rots with time
Colours that flicker in water
A short term effect

Scream
As she tries to push him over
Helpless and sick
With teeth of madness
Jump jump dance and sing
Sideways across the desert
A charcoal face
Bites my hand
Time is sweet
Derange and disengage everything

A day without substance
A change of thought
The atmosphere rots with time
Colours that flicker in water
A short term effect

A short term effect
A short term effect
An echo
And a stranger's hand
A short term effect
An echo
And a stranger's hand
A short term effect

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you

(Fly me to the moon)

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you

&quot;Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick?
The one that makes me scream.&quot; she said
&quot;The one that makes me laugh.&quot; she said
And threw her arms around my neck
&quot;Show me how you do it,
And I promise you,
I promise that
I'll run away with you,
I'll run away with you.&quot;

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
&quot;Why are you so far away?&quot; she said,
&quot;Why won't you ever know
That I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you.&quot;

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Just like heaven

We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk
The way we talk
The way we stalk
The way we kiss
We slip through the streets
While everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker
And wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and
Throw all the songs we know

Into the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
Wonderfully pretty
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea huh?
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up by the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

Hand in hand
Is the only way to land
And always the right way round
Not broken in pieces
Like hated little meeces
How could we miss
Someone as dumb as this

I love you ... let's go
Oh ... solid gone ...
How could we miss someone as dumb
As this?
[end]
