I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well he just drove off sometimes life's OK
I ran my mouth off a bit too much oh what did I say
Well you just laughed it off it was all OK

And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on any way

Well, a fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight of hand
Bad news comes don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well we'll float on good news is on the way

And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on OK
And we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on
Now don't you worry we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Don't worry we'll all float on

(Alright already)
And we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on OK
Don't worry we'll all float on
Even if things get heavy we'll all float on alright
Already we'll all float on alright
Don't you worry we'll all float on alright
We'll all float on

summer
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/summer.html

wake-up we're stealing cars

1996 1997 1998 we're all waiting for the year 2000

just the smell on the summer can make me fall in love

we go to the parties listen to the DJ's

dance dance dance and go crazy

she's a party queen an she's in party heaven

her clock is stuck on late

got a first name basis at 7-11

hold the slip slide taste the sweat it's salty

irrigation ditch and a swimming hole

nation-wide loved the movie

somuchbeautyindirt
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/somuchbeautyindirt.html

Out of breath and out of cash, find yourself watching M.A.S.H., every night

on the couch. Woman says let's take a drive down south, roll down the

windows and open our mouths taste where we are and play the music loud. Stop

the car, lay on the grass, the planets spin and we watch space pass.Walk a

direction, see where we get. I never knew nothin' so there's nothin' to

forget. Get real drunk and ride our bikes. There's so much beauty it could

make you cry. The rich get money but never what they want. Find ourselves a

new place to haunt. Climb up the fire escape do it 'til the ground looks far

away. Go night swimming, leave our clothes on the ground, when we get busted

we just stand there proud. It's the truth we all been wrong make it up and

let's move on. Playing cards we all get to act sly there's so much beauty it

could make you cry.

shitinyourcut
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/shitinyourcut.html

I'd hate to be shit in your cut,
But the package, it's gonna be late
I buried it in an abandoned lot out
When I was young, this was where I'd played

Dug under the fence with my claws
Smelled the cold dirt on my face,
I'm waiting till the hands fall off the clock
Spending dollars at the nickel arcade.

I think I'll ride this winter out,
I guess we'll ride this winter out.

You echo from side to side.
Pacing in your clumsy ballet.
Based on the books and clothes on the floor,
I don't think that this is even your place

When the doctor finally showed up.
Oh boy!
His fur was soaking wet.
He said that &quot;this should do the trick&quot;
We hadn't told him what the problem was yet.

Kaw kaw kaw kaw

We'll have to ride this winter out.
This time we'll ride the winter out.

With the strain and the comforting,
You know that everyone needs to go,
But don't everyone go, don't everyone go at once.

Expulsion from the exoskeleton of our mothers we arrive.
Soft, sticky, cold, we arrive and then start to cry.

All those insects that are trapped in my window once again.
Empty their pockets and I'll sort it at the table.
Line up then shoo 'em off
Sure as hell they'll all get caught in our window pockets full as they are able.

The signs all flicker and buzz all night,
Passing by you could hear them say,
&quot;Hey, please won't you just come on in?&quot;
&quot;Won't you please just go away?&quot;

This time we'll ride this winter out,
I guess we'll ride this winter out
I think I'll ride this winter out

With the straining and the comforting,
I know everyone needs to,
But don't everyone go,
Don't everyone go at once...

This time we'll ride the winter out
I guess we'll ride this winter out
With the straining and the comforting
I know everyone needs to go
But don't everyone go
Don't everyone go at once

This time we'll ride the winter out
I guess we'll ride this winter out
With the straining and the comforting
I know everyone needs to go
But don't everyone go
Don't everyone go at once

This time we'll ride the winter out
I guess we'll ride this winter out
But don't everyone go
Don't everyone go at once

burymewithit
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/burymewithit.html

We were shootin' at a mound of dirt. 

Well nothing was broken, nothing was hurt. 

But I probably really should have been at work. 

But if my freetime's gone, would you promise me this? 


That you will please bury me with it? 

Please bury me with it! 


Well sure as planets come, I know that they end. 

And if I'm here when that happens, will you promise me this my friend? 


Please bury me with it! 

I just don't need none of that Mad Max bullshit. 


Well the suit got tight and it split at the seams. 

But I kept it out of habit and I kept it really clean. 

But if it's getting' faded, if it's runnin' outta thread, 

Could you just do this for me my friend? 


And please just please bury me with it? 

Please bury me with it! 


Well we moved to the left and moved to the right. 

And sure as hell we stayed out almost every single night. 

But if the party's over, if the fun has to end, 

could you do this for me my friend? 


Would you just please bury me with it? 

Please bury me with it! 


Good news for people who love bad news. 

We've lost the plot and we just can't choose. 

We are hummingbirds who are just not willing to move. 

And there's good news for people who love bad news. 

We are hummingbirds who've lost the plot and we will not move. 

We have good news for anyone who loves bad news. 


We were aiming for the moon. We were shooting at the stars. 

But the kids were just shooting at the busses and the cars. 

So don't drink the water, don't you breathe the air. 

If it's gotten to that point then I have to declare: 


That you please bury me with it! 

Please bury me with it! 


Well fads they come and fads they go. 

And God I love that rock and roll! 

Well the point was fast but it was too blunt to miss. 

Life handed us a paycheck, we said, &quot;We worked harder than this!&quot; 


Please bury me with it! 

Please bury me with it! 


We are hummingbirds who are just not going to move. 

And there's good news for people who love bad news. 

We are hummingbirds who've lost the plot and we well not move. 

We have great news for anyone who loves bad news.

polaropposites
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/polaropposites.html

Polar opposites don't push away

It's the same on the weekends as the rest of the days

And I know I should go but I'll probably stay

And that's all you can do about some things

I'm trying to drink away the part of the day

That I cannot sleep away

Two one eyed dogs, they're looking at stereos

Hi-fi Gods try so hard to make their cars low to the ground

These vibrations oil its teeth

Primer gray is the color when you're done dying

I'm trying to drink away the part of the day

That I cannot sleep away

dramamine

Travelling swallowing Dramamine

Feeling spaced breathing out listerine

I'd said what I'd said that I'd tell ya

And that you'd killed the better part of me

If you could just milk it for everything

I've said what I'd said and you know what I mean

But I still can't focus on anything

We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves

Travelling swallowing dramamine

Look at your face like you're killed in a dream

And you think you've figured out everything

I think I know my geography pretty damn well

You say what you need so you'll get more

If you could just milk it for everything

I've said what I said and you know what I mean

But I can't still focus on anything

Oh gotta see, gotta know right now

What's that riding on your everything?

It isn't anything at all

Oh gotta see, gotta know right now

What's that writing on your shelf

In the bathrooms and the bad motels?

No one really cared for it at all

Not the gravity plan

Early, early in the morning

It pulls all on down my sore feet

I wanna go back to sleep

In the motions and the things that you say

It all will fall, fall right into place

As fruit drops, flesh it sags

Everything will fall right into place

When we die, some sink and some lay

But at least I don't see you float away

And all the spilt milk, sex and weight

It all will fall, fall right into place

paperthinwalls
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modestmouse/paperthinwalls.html

These walls are paper thin

And everyone hears every little sound

Everyone's a voyeur, their watching me

Watch them, watch me right now

They're shakin' hands, they're shakin' in their shoes

Oh Lord, don't shake me down

Everyone wants two of them

And half of everyone else who's around

Its been agreed, the whole world stinks

So no ones taking showers anymore

Laugh hard it's a long way to the bank

I can't be blamed for nothin' anymore

It's been a long time since you've been around

Laugh hard it's a long ways to the bank

Tow the line to tax the time, you know

That you don't owe

I can't be a fool for everyone that I don't know

satelliteskin

If you break these moth wing feelings

Powdering dust on your fingers

We know we're not praying we're kneeling

Hard enough just to say you believe them

Well how the heck did you think you could beat them

At the same time that you're trying to be them

Hard enough just to say you don't need it when they

Took it up while you were still eating

Well satellite, satellite skin


Just enough just to say you don't mean it

Well, when everybody's willing to listen

Oh satellite, satellite skin

You can say what you want you're forgiven

Well happy fucking congratulations

Well everyone, everyone wins

Just like being in my own solar system

Doing good things but then totally eclipse them

Oh what the use, oh what the hell


If you break these moth wing feelings

Butterfly knives in the ceiling

Well everyone, everyone's waiting

Detachments get praised and completed

You can say what you want and not mean it

When no one really seems to be waiting

If you sweep up this mess I've created

Nothing's left to show I existed

Except satellite, satellite skin


Asking for a question

Was it easier said than was actually done

Do you even believe that

Do you even believe that there's a race to be won


If you break these moth wing feelings

I have seen it all because satellite skin

Over innocent eyes

I'd like to know these morbid opinions

Get stacked in all those usual avoided spots

Just to tell you how I could not have seen

Through to the gist of those unhappy

Happy accidents

Blame it on the red hand's weight
Get the heath a little fed up
Oh no!
Thank you for closing my cage
I need a carton cigarettes to stay shut up

Blame it on the red hand's weight
Get the heath a little fed up
Oh no!
See if you would open my cage
I need a carton cigarettes to stay shut up

I guess that's just the red hand's fate
How is it I have stayed shut up? Oh no!
Oh no!
