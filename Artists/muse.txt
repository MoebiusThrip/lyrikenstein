I won't stand in your way
Let your hatred grow
And she'll scream
And she'll shout
And she'll pray
And she had a name
Yeah she had a name

And I won't hold you back
Let your anger rise
And we'll fly
And we'll fall
And we'll burn
No one will recall
No one will recall

This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could

Look to the stars
Let hope burn in your eyes
And we'll love
And we'll hate
And we'll die
All to no avail
All to no avail

This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could

This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could
I wish I could

recess
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/muse/recess.html

Resuscitate

In my sleep

Awake to see

You're never here


But the losing yields

Another year

Facing hopes and fears


And I wish

I could believe there was more

Hopes suffocating

You've kissed my life


And the planes and trains

Are to blame

For tempting us

To refrain

And to cut the chord

Dis every word

Of the truths absurd


And I wish

I could believe there was more

Hopes suffocating

You've kissed my life


Hopes suffocating

Hopes suffocating

Hopes suffocating

And you've kissed my life
[end]
ashamed
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/muse/ashamed.html

I know there's something that you're dying to tell me

I hope it's not about your iffy affair

Make sure no-one finds out and tell me all about it

Don't keep it to yourself 'cause I can't bear it

I'd never leave you crying

I know you're crying

Doesn't matter 'cause I'm in control


I know that you're ashamed

So bad it nearly kills you

Don't you know that you're ashamed

So much it almost kills you


There's always something that makes you guilty

There's still something that you're dying to tell me


Make sure no-one finds out

And tell me all about it

Don't keep it to yourself

'Cause I can't bear it

I'd never leave you crying

Oh, no you're crying

That doesn't matter 'cause I'm in control


I know that you're ashamed

So much it nearly kills you

Don't you know that you're ashamed

So much it nearly kills you

resistance
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/muse/resistance.html

Is our secret safe tonight
And are we out of sight
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place
Is this our last embrace
Or will the walls start caving in?

(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it should have been right
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) To let our hearts ignite
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole?
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) This is out of control

(It could be wrong, could be wrong) It could never last
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Must erase it fast
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it could have been right
(It could be wrong, could be...)

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again

Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside

(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it should have been right
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) To let our hearts ignite
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Are we digging a hole?

(It could be wrong, could be wrong) This is out of control
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) It could never last
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) Must erase it fast
(It could be wrong, could be wrong) But it could have been right
(It could be wrong, could be...)

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
It's time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm
Resistance

Your golden lies feed my role

In this forgotten space race under my control

Who's returned from the dead?

Who remains?


You know I don't want you 

and I never did

I don't want you 

and I never will


You wanted more than I was worth

And you think I was scared

And you needed proof

Who really cares anymore?

Who restrains?


You know I don't love you 

and I never did

I don't want you 

and I never will

hysteria
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/muse/hysteria.html

It's bugging me, grating me
And twisting me around
Yeah I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out

'cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive

'cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

And I want you now
I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode

Animal
You're an animal
Don't take anything less

Out of control
You're out of control
Strike those in distress

Analyse
Advertise
Expand
Bend more rules
Buy yourself an island

Animals
We're animals
Buy when blood is on the street

Out of control
We're out of control
Crush those who beg at your feet

Analyse
Franchise
Spread out
Kill the competition
And buy yourself an ocean

Amortise
Downsize
Lay off
Kill yourself
Come on and do us all a favour

liquidstate
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/muse/liquidstate.html

Take me for a ride
Break me up and steal what's left inside
And hope and pray iniquity
Has died inside and left a scar

I'm on red alert
Bring me peace and wash away my dirt
Spin me round and help
Me to divert and walk into the light

Warm my heart tonight
And hold my head up high
And help me to survive

Kick me when I'm down
Feed me poison, fill me till I drown
Wake me up before I get
Pushed out and fall into the night

Warm my heart tonight
(force me to lose control)
And hold my head up high
(watch as I lose my soul)
And help me to survive
(push me until I fall)

Come ride with me
Through the veins of history
I'll show you a god who
Falls asleep on the job

And how can we win
When fools can be kings
Don't waste your time
Or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

Love, it will get you nowhere
You're on your own
Lost in the wild
So come to me now
I could use someone like you
Someone who'll kill on my command
And asks no questions

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

Are you a human drone?
(Aye, sir!)
Are you a killing machine?
(Aye, sir!)
I'm in control, motherfucker, do you understand?
(Aye, sir!)

Your mind is just a program
And I'm the virus
I'm changing the station
I'll improve your thresholds
I'll turn you into a super drone (super drone)
And you will kill on my command
And I won't be responsible

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

Are you a psycho killer? Say &quot;I'm a psycho killer!&quot;
(I am a psycho killer!)
Scream it!
(I am a psycho killer!)
Show me your war face!
(AHHHH!)
You are a pussy! I said show me your war face!
(AHHHH!)

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

I will break you, do you understand?
I will break you, do you understand?
I will break you, do you understand?
I will break you, do you understand?
(Aye, sir!)

You fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now
Your ass belongs to me now
