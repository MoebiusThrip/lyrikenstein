deathletter
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/deathletter.html

I got a letter this morning

how do you reckon it read?

hurry the gal you love is dead


I got a letter this morning

I'm wondering 

how you reckon it read

he said, hurry, hurry

on account that gal you love is dead


I grabbed up my suitcase, I took off down the road

When I got there she was, laying on the cooling board 

Packed up my suitcase and I took off down the road 

When I got there she was laying on the cooling board 


It looked like ten thousand people standing around the burying ground 

I didn't know I loved her, 'til they began to let her down 

looked like ten thousand, people standing around the burying ground 

I didn't know I loved her, 'til they began to let her down 


You know it's so hard to love someone that don't love you 

Don't look like satisfaction, don't care what you do 

so hard to love someone that don't love you 

Don't look like satisfaction, and  don't care what you do 


Well I got up this morning the break of day 

Just hugging the pillow, she used to lay 

Got up this morning would you believe the break of day 

Just hugging the pillow, where my baby used to lay

You got a reaction

You got a reaction, didn't you?

You took a white orchid

You took a white orchid turned it blue


Something better than nothing

Something better than nothing, it's giving up

We all need to do something

Try to keep the truth from showing up


How dare you

How old are you now, anyway?

How dare you

How old are you now, anyway?


You're given a flower

But I guess there's just no pleasing you

Your lip tastes sour

But you think that it's just me teasing you


You got a reaction

You got a reaction, didn't you?

You took a white orchid

You took a white orchid turned it blue


Get behind me

Get behind me now, anyway

Get behind me

Get behind me now, anyway


You got a reaction

You got a reaction, didn't you?

You took a white orchid

You took a white orchid turned it blue

sevennationarmy
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/whitestripes/sevennationarmy.html

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talkin' to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message comin' from my eyes says, &quot;Leave it alone.&quot;

Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it comin' back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones says, &quot;Find a home.&quot;

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera for evermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

And the stains comin' from my blood tell me, &quot;Go back home.&quot;

If you think that a kiss is all in the lips

C'mon, you got it all wrong, man

And if you think that our dance was all in the hips

Oh well, then do the twist

If you think holding hands is all in the fingers

Grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and

Make sure to never do it with the singer

'Cause he'll tell everyone in the world


What he was thinking about the girl

Ya, what he's thinking about the girl, oh


A lot of people get confused and they bruise

Real easy when it comes to love

They start putting on their shoes and walking out

And singing &quot;boy, I think I had enough&quot;


Just because she makes a big rumpus

She don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boy

Take a tip and do yourself a little service

Take a mountain turn it into a mole


Just by playing a different role

Ya, by playing a different role, oh


The boat ya you know she's rockin' it

And the truth well ya know there's no stoppin' it


The boat ya you know she's still rockin' it

The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it


So what, somebody left you in a rut

And wants to be the one who's in control

But the feeling that you're under can really make you wonder

How the hell she can be so cold


So now you're mad, denying the truth

And it's hidden in the wisdom in the back of your tooth

Ya need ta spit it out, in a telephone booth

While ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'em


Where do you think she goes

Oh ya, where d'ya suppose she goes, oh


The truth well you know there's no stoppin' it

And the boat well ya know she's still rockin' it


The boat ya you know she's still rockin' it

And the truth ya you know there's no stoppin' it


You recognize with your back in the back?

That it's colder when she rocks the boat

But it's the cause hittin on the Cardinal Laws?

'bout the proper place to hang her coat


So to you, the truth is still hidden

And the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but

You should know that the doctors weren't kiddin?

She's been singing it all along


But you were hearin' a different song

Ya you were hearin' a different song

But you were hearin' a different song

Now, looky here, momma, let me explain you this,
You wanna get crooked, I'll even give you my fist.
You might read from Revelation back to Genesis,
You get crooked, your southern can belongs to me.

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me,
Your southern can is mine in the mornin',
Your southern can belongs to me.

You might go uptown, have me arrested, put in jail,
Some hotshot's got money, gonna pull my bail.
Soon as I get out, hit the ground,
Your southern can is worth a dollar and half a pound.

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me,
Your southern can is mine, talkin' about it,
Your southern can belongs to me.

You might take it from the south, baby, hide it up north,
Understand you can't rule me or be my boss.
Take it from the east and hide in the west,
But when I get you, momma, you can't a-see no rest.

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me,
Your southern can is mine, I'm screamin',
Your southern can belongs to me.

Now baby, ashes to ashes, sand to sand,
When I hit you, momma, then you feel my hand.
Give you a punch through that barbed wire fence,
When I hit you, baby, you know I make no sense.

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me,
Your southern can is mine, I know it,
Your southern can belongs to me.

Now, look here, woman, don't get hot,
I'm gonna grab me a brick outta my backyard.

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me,
Your southern can is mine, talkin' about it,
Your southern can belongs to me.

Well, if I catch you, momma, down in the heart of town,
I'm gonna grab me a brick and tear your can on down.

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me,
Your southern can is mine, I know it,
Your southern can belongs to me.

You may be deathbed sick, baby, graveyard bound.
Gonna make you moan like a graveyard hound.

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me,
Your southern can is mine, I'm screamin',
Your southern can belongs to me.

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you

Jack give me some money to pay my bills
All the dough I give you Holly
You been using on pain pills
Jack will you call me if you're able?
I got your phone number written
In the back of my bible
Jack I think your pulling my leg
And I think maybe I better ask Meg
Meg do you think Jack really loves me?
You know, I don't care because
Jack really bugs me
Why don't you ask him now?
Well I would Meg
I really just don't know how
Just say 'Jack , do you adore me?'
Well I would Holly but love really bores me
Well maybe we should just be friends
I'm just kidding Holly
You know that I'll love you 'til the end

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you

Holly give me some of your English lovin'
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven
Why don't you go off and just love yourself
If I did that Holly there won't be anything
Left for anybody else
Jack it's too bad about the way you look
You know I gave that horse a carrot
So he'd break your foot
Will the two of you cut it out
And tell 'em what it's really all about

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too but there's
Just so much that I don't know about you
[end]
