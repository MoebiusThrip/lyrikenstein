inoneear
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/inoneear.html

They say that we ain't got the style
We ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's
Gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise
Tryin' to make the radio
I'm an anti-social anarchist
I sound like so and so

They say I'm just a stupid kid
Another crazy radical
Rock'n'roll is dead
I probably should have stayed in school
Another generation X
Who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh they'd love to see me fall
But I'm already on my back


[Chorus:]
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

Now I know I'm not a saint
I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws
I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize
Cast another stone
Burn me at the stake
And sit and watch it from their throne

They say the devil is my pal
I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me
If they're really fuckin' drunk
They think they know my thoughts
But they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words
They'd find a message tucked beneath


[Chorus:]
But it goes in one ear, and right out the other,
People talkin shit, even though they never bother,
It goes in one ear, and right out the other,
People talkin shit, they can kiss the back of my hand!

You hear that?
You hear what's coming?
Oh, you better run for the hills
'Cause we're coming to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down

Here's the moral to the story
We don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money
We don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us
Go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us
Adds the fire to our flames

And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit so you know we never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playing music 'cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

shakemedown
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/shakemedown.html

Shake me down,
Not a lot of people left around,
Who knows now,
Softly laying on the ground, ooooh
Not a lot people left around, ooooh. ooooh

In my life, I have seen,
People walk into the sea,
Just to find memories,
Plagued by constant misery,
Their eyes cast down,
Fixed upon the ground,
Their eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down,
Cut my hair on a silver cloud,
Broken sound,
Softly laying on the ground, ooooh
Not a lot people left around, ooooh, ooooh

In my past, bittersweet,
There's no love between the sheets,
Taste the blood, broken dreams,
Lonely times indeed,
With eyes cast down,
Fixed upon the ground,
Eyes cast down

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Turn back now its time for me to let go,
Way down had to find a place to lay low,
Lampshade turned around into a light post

Walk around the corner,
Never saw it coming still,
I try to make a move,
It almost stopped me from belief,
I don't wanna know the future,
But I'm like rolling thunder,

Even on a cloudy day,
Even on a cloudy day,
Even on a cloudy day,
Even on a cloudy day,
Even on a cloudy day,
Even on a cloudy day,
Even on a cloudy day,

I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the-
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun

Shake me down,
Not a lot of people left around, ooooh, ooooh

telescope
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/telescope.html

In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
Sits around inside his house
From room to room he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out.

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well-spent
Or time I've wasted.

Don't waste it.

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sound
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well-spent
Or time I've wasted...

Clearing my mind,
Losing my friends
Follow my fears
Do it again.
You say how do you do.
Man, how 'bout you?
Man, how 'bout you?
To be free
To be son
To be killed
To be saved
In my head, I'm alone
I'm un-dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you,
I've been tryin' to escape
In my bones I feel cold.
I give thanks to the Lord
In the sea
In this street
Let me go
Let me be,
I don't need to be here,
I'm alone
Can't you see? Can't you see?

I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well-spent
Or time I've wasted...

Don't waste it.

lotus
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/lotus.html

Woke before the morning sun
I found it tucked beneath the hills
I sat and watched it rise
It hit the sky and burst to flames
The lotus flower's
Got me thinkin' 'bout the way that we live
I've got this feelin'
It's gonna stop

Driven by religion
Running backwards down a one way road
A course collision, split decision
Tryin' to save your soul
Manifest Destiny
Is just a fancy word for murder
I've got this feelin'
It's gonna stop


[Chorus:]
A billion faces runnin' round my head
All got opinions but they don't mean shit
Keep droppin' bombs until the whole world's dead
They said it's all been done and it's all been said
They'll turn this message into a pop movement
A fashion statement, call it politics
You can mark my words, they'll put a spin on it
They say it's all been done

Look outside the box my friend
Your heart's been dead since who knows when
It seems we've missed the mark
Lost all hope and given in
Pack up the suitcase
Take that handkerchief and wipe off your chin
The fear that drives you
Needs to be stopped


[Chorus]

Fell into a daze
And found my mind was gone and laid to waste
A battleground indeed
Where holy wars have taken place
I saw the sunset watched it travel down
And tear through the ground
The hate that drives us
Needs to be stopped
[end]
covermeagain
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/covermeagain.html

Heart of steel, born to kill
Mother's milk, left me dressed to shame
I just go my way
Move too fast, it won't last
Hammerhead, Daddy ran away
He still knows my name

Ooh, something's gotta give
The paper on the wall, soon will peel and fall
Ooh, and then you'll see my face, painted up with sin
Cover me, cover me again

I outgrew my old shoes
My backyard was cluttered up with lies
Kept it easy on the eyes
Fresh homemade, under shade
Black and red, paint my fingers blue
Still hiding from the truth

Mmm, my best friend kills the pain
Mmm, but only for a day
Mmm, keeps on chewing on my veins

Ooh, something's gotta give
The paper on the wall, soon will peel and fall
Ooh, then you'll see my face, painted up with sin
Cover me, cover me again
Cover me again

jamesbrown
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/jamesbrown.html

Ran around the corner
Fell asleep in the sun
You had to move into the shade
Before you fire the gun

You got a hunger for destruction
Needed someone to bleed
You sealed the deal before the dawn
You let your actions proceed


[Pre-chorus:]
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later said you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you


[Chorus:]
You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said will somebody take me

Downtown
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said will somebody write this down, down

Fighting back revenge
You've got your face to the ground
You make excuses for the madness
You've been hanging around

You built a house up in the trees
So you could see everyone
You set the clock and had a run
You set the clock and had a run


[Pre-chorus]

Gonna make you mine forever
Never let you leave my side
You can run, you can hide
Girl, I'm gonna make you mine

It's just forever
It's just forever

Never stop until you love me
Even if you treat me cold
I'll love you 'til we decompose
And the skin falls off our bones

It's just forever
It's just forever
It's just forever
It's just forever

Forever (ah)
Forever (ah)
Forever (ah)
Ah

Maybe we can die together
Laying side by side
Even in the afterlife
Girl, you'll still be mine

It's just forever
It's just forever

Promise that you'll never leave me
Promise that you'll follow and lead me
Breathe me all in, taste of my skin
Give me your heart like a hole in the head

Forever (ah)
Forever (ah)
Forever (ah)
Forever (Forever)
Forever

alwayssomething
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/alwayssomething.html

Early in the mornin'
Rise to meet the sun
Work so hard to feed your wife
No time to show her lovin'
And in the madness of the evenin'
With diamonds in your hand
Came home an hour early
Caught her with another man

It's always somethin'
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always somethin' waitin' for ya
Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'

On your way back home again
A Good Samaritan
You see a man stuck in the rain
Stranded with no friends and
From the goodness of your heart
You saved him from the flood
A couple miles down the road
He's covered in your blood

It's always somethin'
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always somethin' waitin' for ya
Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'

Moving around you never see it comin'
Burned by the light you though that you were runnin'
Blinded again, you're floatin like a feather
Why can't you see you can't control the weather?

Sometimes I caught myself
Lookin' in the mirror
With my eyeballs out
And I'm lookin' at the fear
In the bottom of the drain
Saw it growin' like a plant
But it never worked out 
The way I wrote it in my hands
I tried, I tried, I tried, decide, decide, decide... 

It's always somethin'
Before the late night
Around the corner
There's always somethin' waitin' for ya

Can't hold the hands back
Can't make the sun rise
It's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'
You know it's always somethin'

halo
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/halo.html

Every time I get away you
Find a way to reel me back in. (aah)
Tell me that you love me
Hold me tight so we can always be friends. (aah)
I swear
I've said it before, and I say it again! (aah)
Every time I get away you
Find a way to pull me back in. (aah)

Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
Why does it take so lo-oo-ong?

Knew I, couldn't help myself
I had to lay low.
Got so high couldn't help myself
I lost my halo.

Took me by the hand and say
&quot;Remember all the good times we had?&quot; (aah)
I remember how you took my favourite knife
And slipped it under my skin. (aah)
I swear
I've said it before, and I say it again! (aah)
Every time I get away you
Find a way back under my skin.

Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?

Knew I, couldn't help myself
I had to lay low.
Got so high couldn't help myself
I lost my halo.

All my life
With a skeleton.
I had to let go.

Got so high couldn't help myself
I lost my halo.
I lost my halo
I lost my halo

Looking out my window
Wonder how it came to be

Feels just like a tempo
Lifted by a gentle breeze

Ugly as a suitcase
I can see it stretch for days

Hanging on a sunset
Softly trampled by the rain


[Chorus]
Way too long
Hold on
Hold on
Dead and gone
So long
Hold on
Way too long
Hold on
Hold on
Dead and gone
So long
Hold on
So long
Hold on

Looking out my window
Trying to find a hiding place

Climb up to the tree tops
Watch it all just drift away


[Chorus]

trouble
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cagetheelephant/trouble.html

We were at the table by the window with the view,
Casting shadows the sun was pushing through
Spoke a lot of words I don't know if I spoke the truth.

Got so much to lose,
Got so much to prove,
God, don't let me lose my mind.

Trouble on my left,
Trouble on my right,
I've been facing trouble almost all my life.
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you.
I said it was love and I did it for life, did it for you

Will I come to pass or will I pass the test?
You know what they say, yeah, the wicked get no rest.
You can have my heart any place any time.

Got so much to lose,
Got so much to prove,
God, don't let me lose my mind.

Trouble on my left,
Trouble on my right,
I've been facing trouble almost all my life.
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you.
I said it was love and I did it for life, did it for you

Trouble on my left,
Trouble on my right,
I've been facing trouble almost all my life.
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you.
I said it was love and I did it for life, did it for you

Got so much to lose,
Got so much to prove,
God, don't let me lose my mind.

I am the one you left for dead,
(Say you want it too)
You are the bullet in my head,
(Ah)
And as you stand over my grave,
(Tell me it's okay)
Your porcelain lips upon my face.
(Ah)

Either I'm in heaven, or I'm in hell,
Am I losing my mind here
('Cause I can't tell)
I've been waiting for answers for way too long,
Seems I'm always waiting around.


[Chorus:]
Spiders in my head, spiders in my mind,
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind,
It all works out in time,
You know I'm gonna be alright,
You may take my eyes, but baby I'm not blind.

I think your mother wants me dead,
(Say you want it too)
I am a schizophrenic man,
(Ah)
I wouldn't change you if I could,
(Say you want me to)
You treat me cold, I play it cool.

japanesebuffalo

[Spoken:]
One two three four five six
There was a guy, and his name was Johnny B. The loudest man in the land

Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Uh huh

How many more times you cross the line
Run for days with eager eyes
Screaming smile left alone
These crazy things you do
In the forest of your mind
Haunted by the loss of time
Feet stuck frozen in the snow
These crazy things you do

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Alright
OK
Uh huh

Japanese from head to toe
Red to green, green to gold
Waiting on that buffalo
These crazy things you do

In my mind I see the day
Ah ha ha ha, ah ho ho ho
Red to green and green to gold
These crazy things you do

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Shame
Shame
Shame
Oh oh oh

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart, in your mind put me always aside
Do it over again 'til it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules or just
Leave it alone

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
That your heart has turned to stone
Now your heart's turned to stone

Run it over my skin like a cheap plastic knife
In your heart and in your mind
Put me always aside
Do it over again 'til it cuts to the bone
We can play by the rules

It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame

Baby you should know by now that I'm right, for you.
But every time I step to you, you change
Your tune.
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breath
I step to the right, you move to the left.
Unless no one else.
I'd rather die to myself.

Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm starting to unwind.
I been trippin' over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.

Maybe I should pack my things and move on?
Maybe I'm foolin' myself and you're already gone?
Watching the flames wither and fade.
Trying to make sense of the look on your face.
I'm down on my knees
Just prayin' that I can hold on.

Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm learning to unwind.
I've been trippin' over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.

Baby please.
Oh baby please.
Stay with me or cut me free.
It's all of me.
Oh why, won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess.
I'm starting to unwind.
I been trippin' over you.
So tell me something new.
Take it or leave it.
Take it or leave it

Standing there with your red coat on
French perfume looking vulnerable
Black widow girl you sit and wait
Till I climb into the web you made

I'm an animal, 
You got me losing control
You got me losing control 
You got me losing control
It's not right

I can't take it no more girl
I can't take this abuse
Every time that you walk in the room girl
I'm hypnotized by the way that you move
It's the way that you move

You call me out at your beck and call
Set me up just to watch me fall
Twist and turn bend and sway
I move in then you push away

I'm an animal you got me losing control
You got me losing control you got me losing control
It's not right

I can't take it no more girl
I can't take this abuse
Every time that you walk in the room girl
I'm hypnotized by the way that you move
It's the way that you move

I can't take it no more girl
I can't take this abuse
Every time that you walk in the room the room
I'm Hypnotized by the way that you move

I can't tell you the future, I may promise the moon
Cause every time that you walk in the room girl
I'm hypnotized by the way that you move
It's the way that you move
It's the way that you move

Long long time (a long time)

Hold the phone
Hit repeat
You got me foamin at the knees
Saw the flame tasted sin 
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep

Never saw my dark side
In, in your eyes
Back and forth bloody fingers
Paintin up the sky
