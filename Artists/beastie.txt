Oah-kayyyyy!


[MCA:]
You talk and talk and you just can't stop
A word comes to mind, it's &quot;crock&quot;
What you say, is lackluster
Plus it seems you're trying to pull a filibuster


[Mike D:]
Yeah right yeah okay
Tell me somethin new to start the day
Said see you later, when you coming home?
It's a gift, it's a curse, it's the telephone


[Ad-Rock:]
Now let's start over with a nice clean slate
Please stop stressing with the hurry up wait
Heard you the first time, that sounds great
But back up out my space, ok?

Yeah yeah right right - ok!
Ok 
[x4]


[Mike D:]
Wrapped in pink ribbon so pretty
My name's Mike D from New York City
I guess it's all in the mind
But I fell behind


[Ad-Rock:]
I thought it'd be smooth like a nice nutter butter
But I start to cringe every word that you utter
Yes you said yo're a big deal
But money calm down for real


[MCA:]
Got to control my mind
Got to slow down rewind
What is going on in my head?
Why's this sky gone red?

What is goin on in my head?
Why's this sky gone red?
What is going on in my head?
Heard you the fist time that sounds great now


[x3:]
What is goin on in my head? Why's this sky gone red?

What is going on in my head?


[Ad-Rock:]
Now, I don't give a fuck who the hell you are
Please stop shouting in your cellular
I never asked to be part of your day
So please stop shouting in your phone ok?


[MCA:]
You lie like a plain clothes cop
Take a minute take a look and take stock
Take a minute get your mind unlocked
Get open and I'll throw you the rock


[Mike D:]
What's goin on in my head?
And why has the sky gone all red?
Be kind rewind or at least
Tell me what it is I did or just say
What should I say
Hmm, ok?

Yeah yeah right right - Ok
Ok!

[Chorus]


Like The Black Birds I'm A Do It Fluid

Building Rhymes Like Buildings, Like A Stonehenge Druid

Step Up And Get Enlightened, Educating My Mind

I Play The Tape Forward, It's Not Time To Rewind

Step Inside The Mother Fucker And I Get My Flow On

Amalgamating Styles So I've Got Something To Grow On

Season's Change When It Comes Their Time

Falls Brings The Winter And On Back To Springtime

Well, It's The King Ad Rock And That's Who I Am

Listen All Of Y'all I'm Not The Son Of Sam

'Cause I'm Thin And I Don't Grin

But Check It Out People 'cause I Love To Go And Swim

Caught Up On The Phone Fiber Optic Distraction

Information Super Highway Got The Brain Contraction

I'm The Kung Fu Master Vs. The Sumo Wrestler

Got The Beats In Manhatten You Can Hear In Westchester

Well, My Mother Was Born Out In Coney Island

Raised On The L.E.S. Manhatten Island

My Dad Camo Out From Detroit And They Had Me

And Back On Through Ellis Island Goes Through The Family Tree

Well, I'm A Six Point Seven On The Richter Scale

I've Got Rhymes Gallot And Then I Never Fail

Like Gravy To Potatos, Luke To Darth Vader

I'm A Souped Up Sucker And I'll See You All Later


[Chorus]


You See Me Coming Down The Block With The Funky cuts

You Say Mike D. And I Say Mic These Nuts

I've Got Attractions Like I'm Elvis Costello

Adam Yauch Grab The Mic 'Cause You Know You're My Mellow

Well When I Get It Into The Zone

I'm Gonna Take It To A Place Where It's All One

My Shit Is On And The Rhyme Style's Kicking

My Brain Is Flowing Honest Like Abe Lincoln

'Cause I'm The Fuckin' Rythm Ace With The Rhyme Selection

Listen All Y'all I Rap With Perfection

Because I Got The Mother Fuckin' Old School Flavor

That You Savor So Watch Your Behavior

Talking Other Dimensions, Levels Higher

Why Did Billy Joel Say We Didn't Start The Fire

Take You To Another Realm, Another Level

I've Got The Funky Rhymes But I'm Not The Funky Devil

I Step From Minute To Minute, Lifetime To Lifetime

Step From Stage To Stage To See It All Unwind

Slowly But Surely I Seek To Find My Mind

And Every Wall That I Face Is Of My Own Desig

Glendale Boulevard Boulevard

Glendale Boulevard Is Where I'm At

It's Where I'm At, Where I Live

Check It Out Because My Head Is Like A Siv

And We Turn It Out


[Chorus]

girls
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beastieboys/girls.html

Girls, all I really want is girls

And in the morning it's girls

Cause in the evening it's girls


I like the way that they walk

And it's chill to hear them talk

And I can always make them smile

From White Castle to the Nile


Back in the day

There was this girl around the way

She liked by home-piece M.C.A.

He said he would not give her play

I asked him, &quot;Please?&quot; he said, &quot;You may.&quot;

Her pants were tight and that's ok

If she would dance I would D.J.

We took a walk down to the bay


I hope she'll say, &quot;Hey me and you should hit the hay!&quot;

I asked her out she said, &quot;No way!&quot;

I should have probably guessed their gay

So I broke North with no delay

I heard she moved real far away

That was two years ago this May

I seen her just the other day

Jockin' Mike D. to my dismay


Girls - to do the dishes

Girls - to clean up my room

Girls - to do the laundry

Girls - and in the bathroom

Girls, that's all I really want is girls

Two at a time I want girls

With new wave hairdos I want girls

I ought to whip out my girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!

Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic

Another Dimension, Another Dimension


Well Now don't you tell me to smile

You stick around I'll make it worth your while

Got numbers beyond what you can dial

Maybe it's because I'm so versatile

Style profile I said

It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child

From the Hudson River out to the Nile 

I run the marathon til the very last mile

If you battle me I will revile

People always say my style is wild

You've got gall you've got guile 

To step to me I'm a rapophile

If you want to battle your in denial

Coming from Uranus to check my style

Go ahead put my rhymes on trial

Cast you off into exile


Intergalactic planetary

Planetary intergalactic


Jazz and Awol that's our team

Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene

When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend

I like my sugar with coffee and cream

Well I got to keep it going keep it going full steam

Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean

On the tough guy style I'm not too keen

To try to change the world I will plot and scheme

Mario C likes to keep it clean

Gonna shine like a sun beam

Keep on rapping cause that's my dream

Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes

When it comes to envy y'all is green

Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine

Another dimension new galaxy

Intergalactic planetary


Intergalactic planetary

Planetary intergalactic


From the family tree of old school hip hop

Kick off your shoes and relax your socks

The rhymes will spread just like a pox

Cause the music is live like an electric shock

I am known to do the Wop

Also known for the Flintstone Flop 

Tammy D getting biz on the crop

Beastie Boys known to let the beat... drop

When I wrote graffiti my name was Slop

If my rap's soup my beats is stock

Step from the tables as I start to chop

I'm a lumber jack DJ Adrock

If you try to knock me you'll get mocked

I'll stir fry you in my wok

Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop

Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock 


Intergalactic planetary

Planetary intergalactic

Another dimension do it

sabotage
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beastieboys/sabotage.html

I can't stand it I know you planned it
I'm gonna set it straight, this watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
Because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh my God, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage

So listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button?
But yo I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage

Why; our backs are now against the wall
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
But I'm gonna set it straight this watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing - that's sabotage

It's hot here gotta say it's so
I got you right where I want
Got an honest face so you turn your back
When in doubt run up your attack
At one time you were slick and your grill was cold
And now funny how the shit gets old
You can run you can run but it will catch up
Like now see me I'll show you up
Now yo wanna get back when you had your shine
But you run the same thing every time when you rhyme 

Can't stop won't stop no compromise
It's a house of cards built out of lies
Coming down like a bird floating on the mist
Turn on the track back track and twist
You work hard to climb the list
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift

I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)

You're caught now by the skin you're in
In a bind now your thoughts go to all your sins
Hits much harder back better count on that
I tell you what we know always holds us back
Now you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop
I got in your heart and I shook you up
In a bind now your caught by the fear setting in
Choked on the thought that you done it again

Keep the competition in check
You draft your plans at your drafting desk
You try to play to win but now you lost
Like clams with no tartar sauce scheming in the attic
Thought you had it
So dramatic
I - Got the stats mathematics
Automatic - systematic
She's super bad now
Whatcha watcha want now?

I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)

I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win... (danger)

Don't play no game that I can't win
Don't play no game that I can't win

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beastieboys/lookingdownthebarrelofagun.html

I'm rolling down the hill snowballing getting bigger

An explosion in the chamber the hammer from the trigger

I seen him get stabbed I watched the blood spill out

He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout

24 is my age 22 is my gauge

I'm writing rhymes on a page going off in a rage

Out on a mission a stolen car mission

Had a little problem with the transmission

3 on the tree in the middle of the night

I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight

Life comes in phases take the good with the bad

You bought those coins on the street and you got had

Because it's all high spirit you know you gotta hear it

Don't touch the mic baby don't come near it

It's gonna get you it's gonna get you

It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you


Looking down the barrel of a gun

Son of a gun son of a bitch

Getting paid getting rich


Ultra violence running through my head

Fuzzy navel y'all making me see red

Rapid fire Louie like Rambo got bullets

I'm a gonna die harder like my kid Bruce Willis

I love girlies waxing and milking

Coordinating chics is my man Dave Scilkin

Predetermined destiny is who I am

You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam

I am like Clockwork Orange going off on the town

I've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down

I'm mad at my desk and I'm writing all curse words

Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words

You're a headless chicken chasin' a sucker free basin

Looking for a fist to put your face in

Get hip don't slip knuckle heads

Racism is schism on the serious tip
