monster
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kanyewest/monster.html

[Bon Iver:]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?


[Rick Ross:]
Bitch Im a monster no good blood sucker
fat motherfucker now look whos in trouble
as you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West sample, heres one for example


[Kanye West - Chorus:]
Gossip gossip
nigga just stop it
everybody know (Im a motherfucking monster)
Ima need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Ima need to see your fucking hands at the concert
profit profit, nigga I get it
everybody know Im a motherfucking monster
Ima need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Ima need to see your fucking hands...

The best living or dead hands down huh?
less talk more head right now huh?
and my eyes more red than the devil is
and Im bout to take it to another level bitch
none of who you go and get, ain't nobody's cold as this
do the rap and attract triple double no assist
but my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard the people saying raps are getting trap mayne
bought the chain that always give me back pain
fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
she came up to me and said this the number 2 gal
if you wanna make it number one you're number 2 now
this that goose an Malibu I call it Malibooya
God damn Yeezy how we hit em with the new style
know that motherfucker well, what you gonna do now
whatever I wanna do, gosh it's cool now
nah gonna do, uh it's a new now
think you motherfucker really really need to cool down
cause you will never get on top of this
so mommy best advice is just to get on top of this
have you ever had sex with a pharaoh
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus
now she claiming that I bruise her esophagus
head of the class and she just want a swallowship
Im living in the future so the present is my past
my presence is a present kiss my ass


[Kanye West - Chorus]


[Jay-Z:]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong
Lochness, Goblin, Ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
question what do these things all have in common
everybody knows Im a motherfucking monster
conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
none of you niggas have seen the carnage that Ive seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
murder murder in black convertibles
I kill a block I murder the avenues
rape and pillage a village, women and children
everybody wanna know what my Achilles' heel is
Love I don't get enough of it
all I get is these vampires and blood suckers
all I see is these niggas Ive made millionaires
milling about, spilling their feelings in the air
all I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
seems to be the only way to back you bastards up


[Chorus]


[Nicki Minaj:]
Pull up in the monster
automobile gangster
with a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
yeah Im in that Tonka, colour of Willy Wonka
you could be the King but watch the Queen conquer
OK first things first Ill eat your brains
then Imma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
cause thats what a motherfucking monster do
hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster do
monster Giuseppe heel thats the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and the monster crew
and Im all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
and if Im fake I ain't notice cause my money ain't
let me get this straight wait Im the rookie
but my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out!
yeah my moneys so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
hotter than a middle eastern climate
find it Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it
while it, Nicki on them titties when I sign it
have these niggas so one-track minded
but really really I dont give a F-U-C-K
forget barbie fuck Nicki shes fake
shes on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake
and Ill say Bride of Chucky is childs play
just killed another career its a mild day
besides Ye they cant stand besides me
I think me, you and Am* should menage Friday
pink wig, thick ass, give em whiplash
I think big get cash make em blink fast
now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, Im a motherfucking monster!


[Bon Iver:]
I-I crossed the line-line
and Ill-Ill let God decide-cide
I-I wouldnt last these shows
so I-I am headed home

[Intro: Capleton]
Blazing, mi don't want them
Mi need them
Blazing
Suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated
Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
And now she find out what life is really worth
No to X rated


[Intro]
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god


[Hook]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn mnage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of god
My whole life in the hands of god
So y'all better quit playing with god


[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ivan, diamond, Chi-town shining
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!


[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, &quot;What up Yeezus?&quot;
I said, &quot;Shit I'm chilling
Trying to stack these millions.&quot;
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's that cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!


[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm giving up. I'm a god

[Chorus: Brandy]

I always knew that one day

They'd try to bring me down

Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down

Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down

Down, way down


[Kanye]

We're going to mass today, we have to pray

Besides what the pastor say, I have to say

Since Pac passed away

Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me

You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything

There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream

There'll always be haters, that's the way it is

Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids

But they're gonna have to take my life 'fore they take my drive

'cause when I was barely living, that's what kept me alive

Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time

Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind

And get some lee way on the he say she say

You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay

Spanish girls say &quot;No hable ingls&quot;

And everybody want to run to me for their single

It's funny how these wack niggas need my help

Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself

Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself

Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself

Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself

And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help

Now I'll speak from the heart, you all fronting

Everybody feel a way about K but at least you all feel something


[Brandy]

Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you

What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way

forgetting it was that heaven let you. They tried to bring me down


[Chorus - 5X]

[Kanye West]
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat


[Chorus (Kanye West):]
Now, throw your motherfucking hands
GET 'EM HIGH
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man
GET 'EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
KEEP 'EM HIGH
And if your losing your high then* smoke again
KEEP 'EM HIGH


[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow my heart,
And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back,
You see I'm so Chi that you thought it was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash a skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Troy
And I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We're assholes!
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more


[Chorus (Kanye West)]


[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now who the hell is this?
E-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double D
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with her feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli
(You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib)
I mean
(That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib)
I mean
(You don't really know him, why is you lying)
You Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high


[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo
Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?
She's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior
Always got something to say like an OK player hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks on Birth Control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it


[Verse 4: Common]
Get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
You all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
The real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control,
Rap is not a used to but still got love,
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbage of
The year, It's clear your image is snooped up
Label got you souped up, telling you you're sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa, red across your head Imma bred King like Simba
Boulder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a MC with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spitting through wires and fires, MCs retiring
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then


[Chorus (Kanye West)]

Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We bout to get this paper

Money never made me
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me
Even if the money low, can't pay me
Even if the money low, can't play me

Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We bout to get this paper

Pablo bought a Roley and a rottweiler
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
Ive been saying how I feel at the wrong time
Might not come when you want but I'm on time

Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

I cant let these people play me
Name one genius that ain't crazy
Follow our father
You borrow our motto
I'm a Chicago south sider
I'm a Chicago south sider

Ayy, y'all heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on your boy, had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
It's time to get the paper

I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I know, I know, I shouldnt even bother
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
PETA's mad cause I made a jacket outta possum
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same uh that they killed Pac in
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah
You know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!
You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!

You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me.
I don't know what to tell you about him,
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me. 

Every morning, every day of my life.
I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day.
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he...
he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will.
I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name.
Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.

No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there,
with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to.
I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.

Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned

And watch the money pile up, the good life

[Chorus - T-Pain]


[Verse 3]

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane

While getting' some brain

Whipped it out, she said &quot;I never seen snakes on a plane&quot;

Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz

Having' money's not everything, not having it is

I was splurging' on trizz

But when I get my card back activated

I'm back to Vegas cause

I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it

I close my eyes and imagine, the good life


[T-Pain]

Is the good life better than the life I live

When I thought that I was gonna go crazy

And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby

And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky

And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh

I'm good

Find your dreams come true

And I wonder if you know

What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know

What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know

What it means to find your dreams


I've been waiting on this my whole life

These dreams be waking me up at night

You say I think I'm never wrong

You know what, maybe you're right, aight


And I wonder if you know

What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know

What it means to find your dreams


You say he get on your fucking nerves

You hope that he get what he deserves, word

Do you even remember what the issue is

You just trying to find where the tissue is

You can still be who you wish you is

It ain't happen yet

And that's what the intuition is

When you hop back in the car

Drive back to the crib

Run back to their arms

The smokescreens

The chokes and the screams

You ever wonder what it all really mean


And I wonder if you know

What it means, what it means

And I wonder if you know

What it means to find your dreams


And I'm back on my grind

A psychic read my lifeline

Told me in my lifetime

My name would help light up the Chicago skyline

And that's what I'm

Seven o'clock, that's primetime

Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hot lines

Why he keep giving me hot lines

I'm a star, how could I not shine

How many ladies in the house

How many ladies in the house without a spouse

Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused

What you about

On that independent shit

Trade it all for a husband and some kids

You ever wonder what it all really mean

You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams

[Intro - Miley Cyrus:]
Welcome to your life
Diamond through the light
This Miami vice
It's that life okay, okay
Dodging bullets in the air when okay, okay
There's cameras everywhere and okay, okay
You don't know how to act right
Everybody wants to rule the world


[Verse 1 - Kanye West:]
For my theme song black
My leather black jeans on black
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom black
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman skrrt
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in black
Came to see me in my black skin black
Number one question they're asking straight up!
Fuck every question you asking black
If I don't get ran out by Catholics black
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch


[Bridge - Miley Cyrus:]
Acting on your worst behavior
Turn your back on all your haters
Everybody wants to rule the
Everybody wants to rule the world straight up!
The world


[Refrain - Kanye West:]
But there's nowhere to go now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass
Everybody
Everybody


[Chorus - Kanye West:]
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it


[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing, you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action, action
Ready, ready for action


[Chorus]


[Refrain - Kanye West:]
So follow me up cause this shit bout to go down
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass


[Outro - Travis Scott:]
Everybody wanna move it
Get inside it, why they do it
Everybody, ride a little bit
Everybody, body do it
Do it

I just wanna clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
And I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'm a need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty
So let's get on with it

You could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the glory
I know there ain't wrong with me

Something strange is happening

You could've been somethin'
We could've, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body

Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'Nolia

Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my...

To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like &quot;Bad bitch alert&quot;
He Instagram his watch like &quot;Mad rich alert&quot;
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
On and on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie
'Til death but do your part, unholy matrimony

[Man]

Hey Jimmy where you going?


[Jimmy]

I dont know where I'm goin.

My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.

My mom would always say &quot;Dad, why dont you work?&quot;, 

But he just kept learning.

All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school, 

And I was actaully in school all when my dad was in school.

He was so gready with degrees, he took my degree.

And now I'm just glad he left me these.

Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have. 

These are documented.

My father left them for me.

And Im going to leave them to my kids.

I'm going to learn too.

I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.

But I'll be the smartest dead guy.

Who has that.

I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven

When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.

I told God I'd be back in a second,

Man it's so hard not to act reckless.

To whom much is given much is tested.

Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.

I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,

and what I do? Act more stupidly.

bought more jewelry, more Louis V, my momma couldn't get through to me.

The drama, people suing me,

I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.

I'm just saying how I feel man,

I ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to Hill man

I guess the money should've changed him,

I guess I should've forgot where I came from.


[Chorus:]

La, la, la, la wait till I get my money right

la, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right

Excuse Me, is you saying something?

Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing

Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing


Let up the suicide doors.

This is my life homey, you decide yours.

I know that Jesus died for us,

But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.

So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways

Old folks talking about back in my day

But homey this is my day.

Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?

You know I already graduated

And you can live through anything if magic made it.


They say I talk with so much emphasis,

Oh, they're so sensitive.

Don't ever fix your lips like collagen

Say something were you gone end up apologising.

Let me know if it's a problem man,

Alright man, holla then.


[Chorus]


Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,

Let that man get past.

You don't need a stop to get gas,

If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cause

How he move in a room full of no's?

How he stay faithful in a room full of h**s?

Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,

So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.

Treasure. What's you pleasure?

Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.

So if the devil wear Prada,

Adam Eve wear Nada,

I'm in between, but way more fresher.

With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,

That's when you die hard.

Ya homies looking like &quot;Why God?&quot;

When they reminisce over you, my god.


[Chorus]

[end]
