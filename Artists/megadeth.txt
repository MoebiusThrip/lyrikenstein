What do you mean, &quot;I don't believe in God&quot;?
I talk to him every day.
What do you mean, &quot;I don't support your system&quot;?
I go to court when I have to.
What do you mean, &quot;I can't get to work on time&quot;?
I got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean, &quot;I don't pay my bills&quot;?
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh?


[Chorus:]
If there's a new way,
I'll be the first in line.
But, it better work this time.

What do you mean, &quot;I hurt your feelings&quot;?
I didn't know you had any feelings.
What do you mean, &quot;I ain't kind&quot;?
I'm just not your kind.
What do you mean, &quot;I couldn't be the president of the United States of America&quot;?
Tell me something, it's still &quot;We the people&quot;, right?


[Chorus: (repeat)]
If there's a new way
I'll be the first in line,
But, it better work this time.

Can you put a price on peace?
Peace,
Peace sells...,
Peace,
Peace sells...,
Peace sells...,but who's buying?
Peace sells...,but who's buying?
Peace sells...,but who's buying?
Peace sells...,but who's buying?

[n+1 times more]
No, peace sells...

countdowntoextinction
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/megadeth/countdowntoextinction.html

[Mustaine - Ellefson - Menza - Friedman:]

Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you 'Man'
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it; this is the Countdown to Extinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt and take your turn
Liars' anagram is &quot;lairs&quot;
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it; this is the Countdown to Extinction


[Solo - Friedman:]

&quot;One hour from now
Another species of life form
Will disappear off the face of the planet
Forever, and the rate is accelerating&quot;


[Solo - Mustaine &amp; Friedman:]

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it; this is the Countdown to Extinction

hangar18
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/megadeth/hangar18.html

Welcome to our fortress tall
I'll take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For you see the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much.

Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended State of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold but who'd suspect
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much.

symphonyofdestruction
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/megadeth/symphonyofdestruction.html

You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a-roll
A-roll

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction


[Solo - Friedman:]

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A-warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony of Destruction

architectureofaggression
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/megadeth/architectureofaggression.html

[Mustaine-Ellefson:]
Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost
The spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations, built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw, blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your Architecture of Aggression


[Solo - Friedman:]
Ensuing power vacuum
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire
And the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss
The other genocide
Time to pay with your ass
A worldwide suicide

&quot;Fight for America&quot;

&quot;Everybody knew that the 15th
Of January was the deadline date
By kicking the war off, once the war was over
People would be able to go home&quot;


[Solo - Friedman:]
Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost
The spoils of war are yours to keep

Great nations, built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw, blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your Architecture of Aggression

&quot;Fight for America&quot;

&quot;They looked like big long snakes
Coming up in the air&quot;
&quot;Medium sized triple a, um, just, ah tracer bullets&quot;
[end]
