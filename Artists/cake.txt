I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes

I want a girl with the right allocations
Who's fast and thorough
And sharp as a tack
She's playing with her jewelry
She's putting up her hair
She's touring the facility
And picking up slack

I want a girl with a short skirt and a lonnnng jacket......

I want a girl who gets up early
I want a girl who stays up late
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape
With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass

She is fast and thorough
And sharp as a tack
She's touring the facility
And picking up slack

I want a girl with a short skirt and a lonnnnng.... lonnng jacket

I want a girl with a smooth liquidation
I want a girl with good dividends
At Citibank we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen

She wants a car with a cupholder arm rest
She wants a car that will get her there
She's changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She's trading her MG for a white Chrysler LeBaron

I want a girl with a short skirt and a lonnnnggggggggg jacket

The land of race car ya-yas.
The land where you can't change lanes.
The land where large, fuzzy dice
Still hang proudly
Like testicles from rear-view mirrors. 
The land of race car ya-yas.
The land where you can't change lanes.
The land where large, fuzzy dice
Still hang proudly
Like testicles from rear-view mirrors. 

The land of race car ya-yas.
Ya-yas. 

The land of race car ya-yas.
The land of race car ya-yas.
Race car ya-yas.

neverthere
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cake/neverthere.html

I need your arms around me,
I need to feel your touch,
I need your understanding, I need your love,
So much, 

You tell me that you love me so,
You tell me that you care,
But when I need you, (BABY)
Baby, (You're never there), 

On the phone,
Long long distance,
Always through such,
Strong resistance, 

When first you say,
You're too busy,
I wonder if you,
Even miss me, 

Never there,
You're never there,
You're never, ever,
Ever ever there, 

A golden bird that flies away,
A candle's fickle flame,
To think I held you yesterday,
Your love was just a game, 

A golden bird that flies away,
A candle's fickle flame,
To think I held you yesterday,
Your love was just a game, 

You tell me that you love me so,
You tell me that you care,
But when I need you, (BABY)
Baby, 

Take the time,
To get to know me,
If you want me,
Why can't you just show me, 

We're always on,
This roller coaster,
If you want me,
Why can't you get closer, 

Never there,
You're never there,
You're never, ever,
Ever ever there, 

Never there,
You're never there,
You're never, ever,
Ever ever there

thedistance
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cake/thedistance.html

Reluctantly crouched at the starting line,
Engines pumping and thumping in time.
The green light flashes, the flags go up.
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup.

They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank,
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank.
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns.
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern.

As they speed through the finish, the flags go down.
The fans get up and they get out of town.
The arena is empty except for one man,
Still driving and striving as fast as he can.

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up,
And long ago somebody left with the cup.
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns.
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.

He's going the distance.
He's going for speed.
She's all alone, all alone
In her time of need.
Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course,
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse,
He's going the distance.

No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine,
He's haunted by something he cannot define.
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse,
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force.

In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade.
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade.
'Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course,
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse.

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up,
And long ago somebody left with the cup.
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns.
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.

'Cause he's going the distance.
He's going for speed.
She's all alone, all alone
In her time of need.
Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course,
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse.
He's racing and pacing and plotting the course,
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse.
He's going the distance.
He's going for speed.
He's going the distance.

iwillsurvive

At first I was afraid.
I was petrified.
I kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side.
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
I grew strong.
I learned how to get along. 
And so you're back from outer space.
I just walked in to find you here
Without that look upon your face.
I should have changed my fucking lock.
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me. 

Oh now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. 

I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. 

It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart.
I'm trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself.
I used to cry.
But now I hold my head up high. 

And you'll see me with somebody new.
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by,
And you expect me to be free.
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me. 

Oh now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. 

I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive.

You need to straighten your posture and suck in your gut.
You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt.
Yeah, come Comanche, Comanche, Comanche, commode.
If you want to have cities, you've got to build roads. 

You need to find some new feathers and buy some new clothes.
Just get rid of the antlers and lighten your load.
Yeah, come Comanche, Comanche, Comanche, commode.
Yeah, if you want to have cities, you've got to build roads. 

You need to straighten your posture and suck in your gut.
You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt.
Yeah, come Comanche, Comanche, Comanche, commode.
Ah, if you want to have cities,
Yeah, if you want to have cities,
No, if you want to have cities,
You've got to build roads.
