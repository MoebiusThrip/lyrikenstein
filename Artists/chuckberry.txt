Hey! Ev'rybody, let's get it on
You got one more chance 'fore the lights come on
Don't let nobody turn you 'round, go 'head on
Do your thing, come on, get down!

I want to know, can you hear me? Does it sound alright?
Am I comin' through clearly, gettin' down tonight?
Well, go on, do your thing, till I call for the lights

Well, is ev'rybody happy?
I wanna hear you say &quot;Yes&quot;
I wanna know, are you happy?
I wanna hear you confess
Come on, are you happy?
Let me hear you say &quot;Yes&quot;

Turn the house lights on
Let the clock tick on
Turn the house lights on
While I'm playing my song
Let the night roll on
Ev'rybody, rock on!

Do you want us to stop?
Do you want us to play?
Do you want us to go?
Do you want us to stay?
Just diggin' this boogie
All night and all day

Well, hold your hand up higher
So the drummer won't tire
Hold it up a little higher
Set the building on fire
My throat is gettin' drier
So you gotta get higher
(Get on down there now and get it!)

We gotta go now
Yeah, we gotta split
Gotta go get a little bit
No, no, no, no, we gotta quit
I'll go sit by my old git in the pit
Bye, bye, bye, this is it

Now you know we gotta go now
Got to leave the show now
The police at the door now
Gotta close this show now
We really gon' go now
Raise your hand once more now

Get that hand up higher
Well, a little bit higher
I got to see your hand
Yeah, a little bit higher
Well, a little bit higher
Higher, higher

(Get it up there now, get it up there)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, bye, bye

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by, they would stop and say
&quot;Oh my, but that little country boy could play&quot;

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

His mother told him, &quot;Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights
Sayin' 'Johnny B. Goode tonight!'&quot;

Go go
Go Johnny go!
Go go go Johnny go!
Go go go Johnny go!
Go go go Johnny go!
Go
Johnny B. Goode!

Well I'm-a write a little letter
I'm gonna mail it to my local D.J.
Yeah and it's a jumpin' little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
I gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's risin'
The jukebox's blowin' a fuse
My heart beatin' rhythm
And my soul keep-a singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rollin' athritis
Sittin' down at a rhythm review
Roll over Beethoven
They rockin' in two by two

Well if you feel and like it
Go get your lover then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up, yes-a
Try for further then
Reel and rock with one another
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

Well early in the mornin'
And I'm givin' you my mornin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle-diddle, I'm-a play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

You know she wiggle like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see 'em reel an rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
And dig these rhythm and blues

downboundtrain
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chuckberry/downboundtrain.html

A stranger lying on a bar room floor 
Had drank so much he could drink no more
So he fell asleep with a troubled brain 
To dream that he rode on that downbound train

The engine with blood was sweaty and damp 
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp
And imps for fuel were shovelling bones 
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans

The boiler was filled with lager beer 
The devil himself was the engineer

The passengers were most a motley crew
Some were foreigners and others he knew
Rich men in broadcloth, beggars in rags 
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags

As the train rushed on at a terrible pace 
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face
Wider and wider the country grew 
Faster and faster the engine flew
Louder and louder the thunder crashed 
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed

Hotter and hotter the air became 
Till their clothes were burned 
And they were screaming with pain
Then out of the distance there came a yell 
Ha ha said the devil we're nearing home

Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain 
And begged old Satan to stop that train 

The stranger awoke with an anguished cry 
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor 
And prayed a prayer like never before

And the prayers and vows were not in vain 
For he never rode that downbound train

Now darling, you should know
That I'm really, really in love with you
Although you don't belong to me, darling
My heart will always belong to you

There are many, many things all around me
That will always remind me of you
I know I'll never forget you darling
My heart will always belong to you

Since you've been gone, darling
Life for me has been so blue
I guess I'll have to go it alone
Because my heart will always belong to you

Although, although I cannot see you
I could never, never stop lovin' you
I just hope and pray you'll come back to me, darling
'Cause my heart will always belong to you

talkinaboutmybuddy
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chuckberry/talkinaboutmybuddy.html

My buddy finally made a record and took to the road and played guitar
He met this girl from Pennsylvania stuck by his side in love and war
Fearful and fussy, but so faithful, poor and devoted, real and true
She's not the type to be forsaken and I see much of her in you

While on a gig up in Toronto during a pause between his show
He met this foxy German stallion who understood him head to toe
She played it smart and learned his weakness and made him confess and yield into
Her lustful whims became his fancy and I would fear the same from you

Then in the swank suburbs of Houston off in a mansion built of stone
Escorted by this wealthy widow into her lounge and left alone
Her maid announced that she was waiting for him to come and rendezvous
Where he bestowed a long relation one like I hope to have with you

Then on the sands right off the ocean just as the sun sank in the sea
So did my buddy slow and easy into a freak of fancy-free
It was a group in automation getting together two by two
Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you

Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school
Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule
He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do
So they began to come together as I will try to do with you

And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone
She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun
But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true
And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you

The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd shun
Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son
Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through
They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you

Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you
But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through
Sweetheart, I'm talking about my buddy 'cause I don't want to wind up blue
I could be happy with you only 'cause I see all of them in you

I don't want you wait all day 
I don't want you be no slave  
I don't want 'cause I'm sad and blue 
I just want to make love to you, baby 
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby 
Love to you, baby
Love to you
I don't want you wash my clothes
I don't want you keep me home
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you, baby
Love to you

I can tell by the way that you twitch and walk
You know by the way you baby talk
Know by the way you treat your man
I can love you, baby 
[?]

I don't want you wash my clothes
I don't want you keep me home
I don't want 'cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you, baby
Love to you, baby

Love to you, baby
Sweet love...

boundtolose
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chuckberry/boundtolose.html

Looks like I'll go on through my life bound in sorrow
I'm a loser right from the start
Now I've lost the only one I really loved
And I'm bound to this pain in my heart

I am bound because I am so much in love with you
And I know that this love's all in vain
When you let anyone have the love you say is mine
It proves to me I'm a loser again

I am bound with so many sweet memories of you
What more can a poor loser do?
I can't change your ways, I can't make you love me more
I am bound to this crave I have for you

I was bound to lose you when I first fell in love with you
I thought I'd try and love again
Oh, I lost, but kept my chin up and I would pull through every time
But losing you has laid my head in my hands

Havana moon, Havana moon
Me all alone with jug of rum
Me stand and wait for boat to come
Is long de night, is quiet de dark
De boat she late, it's twelve o'clock
Me watch de tide easing in
Is low de moon but high de wind
Havana moon, Havana moon

Me all alone, me open de rum
Is long de wait for boat to come
American girl come back to me
We'll sail away across de sea
We'll dock in New York
De building's high
We find a home in de sky
Havana moon, Havana moon

Me still alone, me sip de rum
Me wonder when de boat she come
To bring me love, oh sweet little thing
She rock 'n' roll, she dance and sing
She hold me tight, she touch me lips
Me eyes they close, me heart she flip
Havana moon, Havana moon

But still alone me drinking de rum
Begin to think de boat no come
American girl she tell a lie
She say &quot;Till then,&quot; she mean &quot;Goodbye&quot;
Havana moon, Havana moon

Me lay down alone, was good de rum
Me fall asleep, de boat she come
De girl she look till come de dawn
She weep and cry, return for home
De whistle blow, me open me eyes
Was bright de sun, was blue de sky
Me grab me shoes, me jump and run
Me see de boat head for horizon
Havana moon, is gone de rum

De boat she sail, my love she gone
Havana moon, Havana moon
Havana moon, Havana moon
