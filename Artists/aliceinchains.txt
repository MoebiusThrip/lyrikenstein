Yeah, I want to travel south this year
Aaah, Woah, Woah
Won't prevent safe passage here

Why you act crazy
Not an act maybe
So close a lady
Shifty eyes shady

Yeah, hey Yeah, tears that soak
A callous heart

Why you act frightened
I am enlightened
Your weakness builds me
So someday you'll see

I stay away

Why you act crazy
Not an act maybe
So close a lady
Shifty eyes shady

I stay away

You know I don't need you

Honey I don't need you

Hard drinker...feelin' uptight

Every time you lie it's all the same
Ooo, if you need a rhyme to kill the singer
Shoot me dead before I may be through

One, a-one time, yeah

Am I too contagious
Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise
Burning corpsed pyre

Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more
Suck your woman down

Am I your reflection
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value
Do my love defile

Then some dude came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more
Ain't no day the sun don't crack
Then to brand some name across my back so you care?
Find someone to tell you

Sunshine...sweet love my labor
Don't mind...I don't care no more

Memory, set me free, yeah
I don't care no more
Mother please, come for me

Can you face the question?
Is my soul entire?

Sunshine...sweet love my labor
Don't mind...I don't care no more

itaintlikethat
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliceinchains/itaintlikethat.html

There I was, laid out on a table
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor
In my life, I'd not soften
Things that cut, and burn so often
But I sit, think of somethin'
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin'

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore

Where I go is when I feel I'm able
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore
In my mind, not forgotten
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin'
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin'

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore

Here I sit writing on the paper
Trying to think of words you can't ignore
In my eyes, what I'm lacking
Score at face, a ten for slacking
Sign the deal, set in motion
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
[end]
hollow
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliceinchains/hollow.html

Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

All of your colours turn to grey
Don't even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Can't really say how you lost your mind

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can't tell my up from down

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can't tell my up from down

All of the faces life can show
Withered and ugly the one you know

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can't tell my up from down

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can't tell my up from down

A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah

California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain

I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah

California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain

Aaaaah tears that filled my bong
Aaaaah years expended gone


[Guitar]

I hung my guns and put em away, oh yeah
The trick of the trade, and by the way, oh yeah

California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain

Aaaah tears that filled my bong
Aaaah years expended gone

Check my brain, check my brain...

rooster
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliceinchains/rooster.html

Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere

Here they come to snuff the rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, ya know he ain't gonna die

Here they come to snuff the rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, ya know he ain't gonna die

Walkin' tall machine gun man
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathin' his dyin' breath
Oh God please won't you help me make it through

Here they come to snuff the rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no ya know he ain't gonna die

At the bottom of the hill
Jack busted his crown

Ah, my fairytale love story
My fairy life

To get you off of my..
I got to thinking
Things aren't as good as they can be
I got to drinking
The bitch is over the brink
The bitch is over the brink

Tommy Prince, kissed a few there on the lips
She woke him with a cold sore, she ain't so pretty no more

Ah, my fairytale love story
My fairy life
My fairytale love story
To get you off of my..
I got to thinking
I'm not as sweet as them all
I got to drinking again
The bitch is over the brink
The bitch is over the brink

My fairytale love story

Ooo, my fairytale love story

The bitch is over the brink

No more time
Just one more time

So crazy, beat the strain
Too lazy, shake the gray
So as she willed the rain
So let me be defamed
Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Like puppets on a string
Untangle you from me

Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

No more time
Just one more time

Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Like puppets on a string
Untangle you from me
So crazy, beat the strain
Too lazy, shake the gray
So as she willed the rain
So let me be defamed

Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

One day my plane leaves
Some way my head creeps
Some day my way leads
Some way my head creeps

No more time
Just one more time

Empty room sets the scene
Pick at me slow, pain free
Suck me through barbed screen
Anger becomes our queen
Tongue whipping forked black
How long until you crack
Surprised and set back
Lackeys' loose talk for fact


[x2:]
Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin'
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again

One day my plane leaves
Some way my head creeps
Some day my way leads
Some way my head creeps
Creeps

No more time
Just one more time

So crazy feel the hate
Yeah, I've got years to wait
I know it's not too late
Lending clean hands of fate
Rise from the dirt I'm in
Hide in another's skin
Stick black dress doll with pin
Your mouth takes on my grin

So crazy 
[x3]

What does friend mean to you?
A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused
All included but you
Alone...

The sounds of silence often soothe
Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen and change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue

Why's it have to be this way
Be this way 
[5x]

Flowers watched through wide brown eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon

Why's it have to be this way
Be this way 
[5x]

&quot;At 7 am on a Tuesday, usual August ...
Next week I'll be 28...
I'm still young, it'll be me...
Off the wall I scrape... you...
I can't wake, I gotta wake...
To cause this wake, I gotta wake no more...
It causes wake, to drown this hate....
To never really stay, never will.....
You take your plate...
Put me through hell, live, live...
Direct your fate...
You say I can do it so well...
Your expiration date... 
[2x]
Fate, date, expiration date...
(this was the last time)
Hate...
And don't fuck with me again...
My own clean slate...
Don't fuck with me again...
Makes your eyes dilate...
Makes you shake...
Irate...&quot;

hatetofeel

What's gone wrong, I can't see straight
Been too long, so full of hate

What the fuck will it take
Drown myself in my wake
Another shaggy D.A.
Now a dog, shake my leg
Plastic man, paper face
Candy heart, what a waste
Gotta change, set a date
Eat my cake, lick my plate

Stare at me with empty eyes and
Point your words at me
Mirror on the wall will show you
What you're scared to see

I can see, yeah - (wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see - (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)

So climb walls,
Thin my blood now
And I crawl, back to bed now

What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance

All this time I swore I'd never
Be like my old man
What the hey it's time to face
Exactly what I am

I can see, yeah - (wish I couldn't see at all)
I can feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
Hate to see - (wish I couldn't see at all)
Hate to feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)

What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance

All this time I swore I'd never
Be like my old man
What the hey it's time to face
Exactly who I am

So you got the thing you wanted
Don't let it go
though it hurts your hand to hold it
Don't let it show

I'm pretty done
Once a favored son
I'm pretty done
Slap me 'round for fun

Finding no pleasant changes
In old enemies
Not a lead a bit part playing
In my story

I'm pretty done
Once a favored son
I'm pretty done
Slap me 'round for fun

I don't care to further amuse you
Never had you how, could I lose you?
Paid in full, I owe no one at all

I'm supposed to smile and ignore it
Better than some
High roads are to fall from
Already hung

I'm pretty done
Once a favored son
I'm pretty done
Slap me 'round for fun

Pushing towards hopeless mission
Curiosity, omission
History colored since the fall

I'm pretty done
I'm pretty done
I'm pretty done
I'm pretty done

Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care

What do I see across the way, hey
See myself molded in clay, oh
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid, hey
Changing the shape of his face, aw yeah

Candles red I have a pair
Shadows dancing everywhere
Burning on the angry chair

Little boy made a mistake, hey
Pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh
All that I want is to play, hey
Get on your knees, time to pray, boy

I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I

Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I-I-I
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind

Corporate prison, we stay, hey
I'm a dull boy, work all day, oh
So I'm strung out anyway, hey

Loneliness is not a phase
Field of pain is where I graze
Serenity is far away

Saw my reflection and cried, hey
So little hope that I died, oh
Feed me your lies, open wide, hey
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh

I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I

Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I-I-I

Come to me, I'll fill the hole
Why would I be lying
End fan, all planned out
Offering a wonderful
Peace of mind worth buying
Bow down last round up

I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got a 'maginary friend

The devil put dinosaurs here
Jesus don't like a queer
The devil put dinosaurs here
No problem with faith just fear

Promise those who've gone before
Waitin' on you flyin'
Leading, receiving us
I'm as flawed as any man
Look at me I'm smiling
Drink me, eat me up

I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got a 'maginary friend

The devil put dinosaurs here
Jesus don't like a queer
The devil put dinosaurs here
No problem with faith just fear

I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got a 'maginary friend

The devil put dinosaurs here
Jesus don't like a queer
The devil put dinosaurs here
The problem with faith

Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way

Watch where you spit
I'd advise you wait until it's over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better

And we die young
Faster we run

Down, down, down you're rollin'
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

And we die young
Faster we run

Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way

Another alley trip
Bullet seek the place to bend you over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better
Faster we run
And we die young

Hope, a new beginning
Time, time to start living
Like just before we died

There's no going back to the place we started from

Hurt, falling through fingers
Trust, trust in the feeling
There's something left inside

There's no going back to the place we started from
All secrets known

Calm, old wounds are healing
Strong, truth is worth saving
I want to feel alive

There's no going back to the place we started from
All secrets known

Time to change has come and gone
Watched your fears become your God
It's your decision
It's your decision

Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision
It's your decision

You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside

No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over

It might seem an afterthought
Yes, it hurts to you know you're bought
It's your decision
It's your decision

You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside

It's your decision
It's your decision

No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over

I tried to love you I thought I could
I tried to own you I thought I would
I want to peel the skin from your face
Before the real you lays to waste

You told me I'm the only one
Sweet little angel you should have run
Lying, crying, dying to leave
Innocence creates my hell

Cheating myself still you know more
It would be so easy with a whore
Try to understand me little girl
My twisted passion to be your world

Lost inside my sick head
I live for you but I'm not alive
Take my hand before I kill
I still love you, but, I still burn

Yeah, Love, hate, love 
[3x]
Oooh, Love, hate, love
Yeah, Love, hate, love

What the hell am I?
Thousand eyes, a fly
Lucky then I'd be
In one day deceased

Sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine

What the hell am I?
Leper from inside
Inside wall of peace
Dirty and diseased

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine

Can you see the end?
Choke on me my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot

&quot;Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair
With head high and eyes alert
I tread on a plane of many
We who are of good nature and intention,
But cannot touch on the dark
Recesses of memory
And pain learned, so come walk
With me, feel the pain,
And release it...&quot;

What the hell am I?
Worn eroded pride
Saddened 10 miles wide
I'm gonna let it slide

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine
Ahh, etc., etc.

Hung on a hook I'm a mirror
Cracked down the center I split you
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes

Show you the face of a man who
Not that he wants but he has to
Look at the thing he's become, what I see

I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change

Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head

Pieces of me on a tile floor
Look up at you as you change more
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times

Hold a reflection inside me
I cannot feel you are empty
Throw me away
I am broken not your time

I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change

Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head

Not gonna save you
Perform euthanasia

lyingseason

There's no reason
To deny
It's the season
Of the lie

Having someone
Grin at you
Look at little fingers
Pointing truth

Man it's a weight on my mind
And that's fine
But now we wade past the point of decline 
There's no time

I'm a believer
In the new
Past receiver
All come true

Look to the east
Filled with hate
Neutral flashers
While we wait

Man it's a weight on my mind
And that's fine
But now we wade past the point of decline
There's no time

I'm an old lover
You're so sane
Who's the answer
Of what I mean

In this ocean
I fell into
Break me out of
The shell I grew

Man it's a weight on my mind
And that's fine
But now we wade past the point of decline
There's no time

There's no time 
(There's no time) 
There's no time
(There's no time)
No time
(There's no time)
No time
(There's no time)

&quot;I'm serious, there's big money going on&quot;
&quot;Big big money!&quot;

Why are here again?
It's the same old sit down roll around chewed up pen

Nothin thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothin thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothin thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothin thrilling me...

Yeah, so close now
Yeah, so close now

Man I nearly snapped my twig
Then again I nearly snapped a few of you

So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think...

Yeah, so close now
Yeah, so close now

Why?

grind

In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah
Come the morning light, it's a see through show
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Sure to play a part, so you love the game
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah
I could set you free, rather hear the sound
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah


[x2:]
Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Why can't I take it all OK?
I like to dig and fuck around with your day
I'm gonna tell your mamma
Yeh I'm gonna blackball your name
Ain't no way you'll go without me
Every chance I'll make you pay

On your face, in my space, I tell you I know
Somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know somethin'
'Bout you, I know somethin'

Why can't I put your words away
I'd like to have more of you in my veins
I'm gonna tell your papa
Yeh I'm gonna try and ball your babe
Your gold key don't fit my crapper
Ain't got no shit today

On your face, in my space, I tell you I know
Somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know somethin'
[2x]
'Bout you, I know somethin'

I'm gonna tell your mama
Yeh I'm gonna blackball your name
Ain't no way you'll go without me
Every chance I'll make you pay

Somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know somethin'

'Bout you, I know somethin'

Hey, let them do it again, yeah
Hey, you said you were my friend
Hey, turn me upside down, Oh
Hey, feelin' so down
Hey, hey...hey...hey...

You made a fool of me again
Again 
[8x]

Hey, I know I made the same mistake, yeah
I, I won't do it again, no
Why, Why you slap me in the face, oww
I, I didn't say it was OK, no
No, No...

You violate a part of me again
Again 
[8x]

Ah, ooo
Doot doot, yeah 
[8x]

Hey, you had time to think it out, yeah
Hey, Your weak will won't help her heal her heart
Hey, I'll bet it really eats you up

Extending part of me again
Again 
[8x]

Ooo
Doot doot, yeah

Anybody out there
Anyone at all
Can you finally hear this deep in
Scratching through the wall
Came far to find me
Down the rabbit hole
Watch me smiling back while chewing on my skull

I know, won't forget
Limped away from the wreck

Is the monkey breathing
Looking kinda sick
Got a witty comment for me
Have yourself a kick
Does it make you feel good
Are you full and strong
Gonna end up in this cage and I hope your stay is long

I know, won't forget
Limped away from the wreck

We'll never know what this is
'til we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies

We'll never know what this is
'til we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before

Had enough, I don't need you to stick my hide
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry
Had enough, I don't need you to blind my eyes
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry

I know, won't forget
Limped away from the wreck

We'll never know what this is
'til we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies

We'll never know what this is
'til we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies

Had enough, I don't need you to stick my hide
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry
Had enough, I don't need you to blind my eyes
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry

The face before me flies
Laughs at me inside
Masks are made to hide the glow
Shining eyes
Distance 'tween us grows
Feeding lies

It's hard to start things over
You can feel the fire around us
All the time
Yeah

Something I should say
It takes you every day
What you give is not alive
Today
Your soul served on a plate
Throw it away

It's hard to start things over
You can feel the fire around us
All the time
Yeah

It's hard to start things over
Oh yeah
You can feel the fire around us
All the time
Yeah

It's hard to start things over
Oh yeah
You can feel the fire around us
All the time
Yeah

All the time

What the hell have I?
Little pride

damthatriver
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/aliceinchains/damthatriver.html

I broke you in the canyon
I drowned you in the lake
You a snake that I would trample
Only thing I'd not embrace

Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away

I pushed and then you stumbled
I kicked you in the face
You stare at me so hollow
Got to keep that killin' pace

Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away

I burned the place around you
I hit you with a rake
You piss upon my candle
So proving you're a fake

Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away
[end]
