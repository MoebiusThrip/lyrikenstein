Yeah
Yeah
Yeah it's about the time we'd like to present you to the electric church
And baby if you would you all listen to our notes
Here here in our seens, playin'
Instead of rappin' like I am now
Then maybe I'll well maybe this is good enough
What ya think we stick with songs
It's all freedom

There's a red house, over yonder baby
That's where my baby stays
Lord there's a red house over yonder, baby
Lord that's where my baby stays

I ain't been home to see my baby
In about a ninety-nine and one half days
It's about time to see her
Wait minute something's wrong, babe
Lord have mercy this key won't unlock this door

Wait a minute something's wrong,
Wait a minute something's wrong baby,
Wait a minute something's wrong baby,
Lord have mercy the key won't unlock this door

No one knows where she comes from
Maybe she's a devil in disguise

Little miss strange
Little miss strange.

Little miss strange came into my parlor
I don't know just what to ask her
I don't remember what we did after.

Little miss strange
Little miss strange.

Little miss strange came out of the darkness
Walked across my head, I stood beneath the light
I'm talkin' 'bout the dream I had the other night.

Little miss strange
Little miss strange

Purple Haze all in my brain,
lately things don't seem the same,
actin' funny but I don't know why
'scuse me while I kiss the sky.

Purple Haze all around,
don't know if I'm coming up or down.
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me.

Help me
Help me
Oh no, oh

Yeah, Purple Haze all in my eyes,
don't know if it's day or night,
you've got me blowing, blowing my mind
is it tomorrow or just the end of time?

Help me, yeah, Purple Haze!

[Verse 1]
Oh strange beautiful grass of green
with your majestic silken scenes
Your mysterious mountains
I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine


[Verse 2]
Although your world wonders me
with your majestic superior cackling hen
Your people I do not understand
So to you I wish to put an end
And you'll never hear surf music again

loveorconfusion
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimihendrix/loveorconfusion.html

Is that the stars in the sky or is it raining far from now?
Will it burn me if I touch the sun,
so bit, so round?
Will I be truthful, yeah,
in choosing you as the one for me?

Is this love baby,
or is it-a just confusion?

Oh, my mind is so mixed up, goin' round 'n' round_
Must there be all these colors without names,
without sounds?
My heart burns with feelin' but
Oh! but my mind is cold and reeling.

Is this love, baby
or is it confusion?

Oh, my head is pounding pounding
going 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round.
Must there always be these colors?

Hurrah i awake from yesterday
alive but the war is here to stay
so my love catherina and me
decide to take our last walk
through the noise to the sea
not to die but to be re-born
away from a life so battered and torn....
forever...
oh say can you see its really such a mess
every inch of earth is a fighting nest
giant pencil and lip-stick tube shaped things
continue to rain and cause screaming pain
and the arctic stains
from silver blue to bloody red
as our feet find the sand
and the sea is strait ahead..
strait ahead.....
well its too bad 
that our friends 
cant be with us today
well thats too bad
&quot;the machine 
that we built 
would never save us&quot;
thats what they say
(thats why they aint coming with us today)
and they also said
&quot;its impossible for man
to live and breath underwater..
forever&quot; was their main complaint
(yeah) 
and they also threw this in my face:
they said
anyway
you know good well
it would be beyond the will of God
and the grace of the King
(grace of the King yeah yeah)

so my darling and I
make love in the sand
to salute the last moment 
ever on dry land
our machine has done its work
played its part well
without a scratch on our bodies
and we bid it farewell

starfish and giant foams 
greet us with a smile
before our heads go under
we take a last look
at the killing noise 
of the out of style...
the out of style, out of style

somewhere
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimihendrix/somewhere.html

Oh uh,
I see fingers, hands and shades of faces,
Reachin' up and not quite touchin' the promised land,
I hear pleas and prayers and a desperate whisper sayin,
Oh, Lord, please give us a helpin' hand,
Yeah yeah

Way down in the background,
I can see frustrated souls of cities burnin,
And all across the water,baby,
I see weapons barkin' out the sting of death,
And up in the clouds I can imagine UFOs jumpin' themselves,
Laughin' they sayin',
Those people so uptight, they sure know how to make a mess

Back in the saloon my tears mix and mildew with my drink,
I can't really tell my feet from the sawdust on the floor,
But as far as I know, they may even try to wrap me up in cellophane and try and sell me
Brother sell me, and don't worry about lookin at the score
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

voodoochile

Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord I'm a voodoo chile

Well, the night I was born
Lord I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well my poor mother cried out &quot;lord, the gypsy was right!&quot;
And I seen her, fell down right dead
(Have mercy)

Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagles back
Well, mountain lions found me there,
And set me on a eagles wing
(Its' the eagles wing, baby, what did I say)
He took me past to the outskirts of infinity,
And when he brought me back,
He gave me a venus witch's ring
Hey!
And he said &quot;Fly on, fly on&quot;
Because I'm a voodoo chile, yeah, voodoo chile
Hey!

Well, I make love to you,
And lord knows you'll feel no pain
Say, I make love to you in your sleep,
And lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
'Cause I'm a million miles away
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah! What did I say now)
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows, I'm a voodoo chile
(yeah!) 

Well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
(Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah)
I have a humming bird and it hums so loud,
You think you were losing your mind, hmmm...

Well I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand
(Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand

Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue,
Way down in California
And the in New York drowns as we hold hands

'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile

Always up, you never let me down
The amazing thing, you turn me on naturally,
And I kiss you when I please.

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' across and through
You make me float right on up to you
There's only one thing I need to really get me there,
Is to hear you laugh without a care.

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please 

Now your Daddy's cool, and your Mamma's no fool,
They both know I'm heads over heels for you,
And when the day melts down into a sleepy red glow,
That's when my desires start to show.

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please.

castlesmadeofsand
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimihendrix/castlesmadeofsand.html

Down the street you can hear her scream &quot;you're a disgrace&quot;
As she slams the door in his drunken face,
And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool.

He cries &quot;Oh girl, you must be mad,
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?&quot;
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
And his tears fall and burn the garden green.

And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually.

A little Indian brave who before he was ten, played war games in
the woods with his Indian friends, and he built a dream that when he
grew up, he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.

Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song,
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,
Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually.

There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die.
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled

&quot;You won't hurt me no more.&quot;
But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY
&quot;Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way&quot;
And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, 
Eventually

Hey man, it's rainin'

Aw, don't worry 'bout that
Everything's gonna be everything
We'll get into somethin' real nice you know
Sit back and groove on a rainy day
Yeah
Yeah I see what you mean brother, lay back and groove.

Rainy day, dream away
Ah let the sun take a holiday
Flowers bathe an' ah see the children play
Lay back and groove on a rainy day.

Well I can see a bunch of wet creatures, look at them on the run
The carnival traffic noise it sings the tune splashing up 'n'
Even the ducks can groove rain bathin' in the park side pool
And I'm leanin' out my window sill diggin' ev'rything
And ah and you too.

Rainy day, rain all day
Ain't no use in gettin' uptight
Just let it groove its own way
Let it drain your worries away yeah
Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey
Lay back and dream on a rainy day

&quot;There must be some kind of way out of here,&quot;
Said the joker to the thief,
&quot;There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Businessmen - they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody of it is worth.&quot;

&quot;No reason to get excited,&quot;
The thief - he kindly spoke,
&quot;There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late.&quot;

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl, hey.

boldaslove
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimihendrix/boldaslove.html

Anger, he smiles,
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground

Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on
But they're all bold as love, yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring,
But very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frigthened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from, eh,
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
But, I'm eh , yeah, I'm bold as love
Yeah, yeah
Well I'm bold, bold as love (hear me talking, girl)
I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis (he knows everything)
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah!

Yeah, his guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots is his cadillac
Flamin' hair just a blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin
He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see
But everybody knows the boss
A rolling stone who gathers no moss

But you'd probably call him a tramp
But it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile, yeah

Now some people say he had a girl back home
Who messed around and did him pretty wrong
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad
Kinda made him feel pretty sad
I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway, he left the world behind
But everybody knows the same old story,
In love and war you can't lose in glory

Now you'd probably call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile

Walk on brother, yeah
One more brother

His old guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots is his cadillac
Flamin' hair just a blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin

Now you may call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile

Walk on brother
Don't let no one stop you
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile
Go on down the highway
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile

Little Miss Lover, where have you been in this world for so long?
Well, I love a lover that feels like you, would you like to tag along?

Well, I really don't need any help little girl,
But I think you could help me out anyway
Would you believe, baby, I've been looking for a Sun
That feels like you For some time

Excuse me while I see if the gypsy in me is right
If you don't mind

Well, he signals me O.K.
So I think it's safe to say,
I'm gonna make a play, ohhh yeah!
Hey, hey, little Miss Lover,
There's so much you and me can discover
And I think we should start, start right now
Hey little Miss Lover!

Here I come to save the day

A little boy inside a dream just the other day
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away
A hand came out from heaven and pinned a badge on his chest
It said 'get out there, man, and do your best'

They call him astro man
And he's flyin' higher than
That faggot superman ever could

Oh, they call him cosmic nut
And he's twice as dense as donald duck
And he'll try his best toscrew you up
The rest of your mind
Oh, look out! my guitars

Astro man, flyin' across the sky two times higher
Than that old faggot superman ever, ever could
Ever could

There he goes, there he goes
Where he stops, no one knows
There he goes, there he goes
He's tryin' to, tryin' to blow out the rest of your mind
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind
Talkin' about lookin' for peace of mind
Astro man will leave it in pieces
Have you put our trouble behind him
Make you fly around in pieces
Yeah, blow out the rest of your mind
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind
He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind

I just want to talk to you. I won't uh, do you no harm,
I just want to know about your different lives, on 
this here people farm.

I heard some of you got your families, living in 
cages tall &amp; cold,
And some just stay there and dust away, past the 
age of old.
Is this true? Please let me talk to you.

I just wanna know about, the rooms behind 
your minds,
Do I see a vacuum there, or am I going blind?
Or is it just remains from vibrations and echoes 
long ago,
Things like 'Love the World' and 'Let your fancy
flow',
Is this true? Please let me talk to you. Let me 
talk to you.

I have lived here before, the days of ice,
And of course this is why I'm so concerned,
And I come back to find the stars misplaced
and the smell of a world that has burned.

The smell of a world that has burned.

Well, maybee, maybe it's just a change of 
climate.
I can dig it, I can dig it baby, I just want to see.

So where do I purchase my ticket,
I would just like to have a ringside seat,
I want to know about the new Mother Earth,
I want to hear and see everything,
I want to hear and see everything,
I want to hear and see everything.
Aw, shucks,
If my daddy could see me now.

Well I realize that I've been hypnotized,
I love your gypsy eyes
I love your gypsy eyes
Alright!

Hey!
Gypsy.

Way up in my tree I'm sitting by my fire
Wond'rin' where in this world might you be
And knowin' all the time you're still roamin' in the country side
Do you still think about me?
Oh my gypsy.

Well I walked right on to your rebel roadside
The one that rambles on for a million miles
Yes I walk down this road searchin' for your love and ah my soul too
But when I find ya I ain't gonna let go.

I remember the first time I saw you
The tears in your eyes look like they're tryin' to say
Oh little boy you know I could love you
But first I must make my get away
Two strange men fightin' to the death over me today
I'll try to meet cha by the old highway.
Hey!

Well I realize that I've been hypnotized, I love your gypsy eyes
I love your gypsy eyes
I love your gypsy eyes
I love your gypsy eyes
Alright!

I've been searchin' so long my feet have made me lose the battle
Down against the road my weary knees they got me
Off to the side I fall but I hear a sweet call
My gypsy eyes is comin' and I've been saved.

Oh I've been saved
That's why I love you uh
Said I love you
Hey!
Love you uh
Lord I love you
Hey!

Well. I'm up here in this womb
I'm looking all around
Well, I'm looking out my belly button window
And I see a whole lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they don't want me around

What seems to be the fuzz out there?
Just what seems to be the hang?
'cause you know if ya just don't want me this time around,
Yeah I'll be glad to go back to spirit land
And even take a longer rest,
Before I'm coming down the chute again
Man, I sure remember the last time, baby
They were stlll hawkin' about me then
So if you don't want me now,
Make up your mind, where or when
If you don't want me now,
Give or take, you only got two hundred days
'cause I ain't coming down this way too much more again

You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think you're just a little too late
So I'm coming down into this world, daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And I'm gonna sit up in your bed, mama
And just a grin right in your face
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates,
And say 'i hope I'm not too late'

So if there's any questions,
Make up your mind
'cause you better give or take
Questions in your mind
Give it a take,
You only got two hundered days

Way up into this womb
Looking all around
Sure's dark in here
And I'm looking out my belly button window
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they want me around

After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street footsteps dressed in red

And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping up the broken pieces of yesterdays life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries Mary

The traffic lights, they turn, uh, blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags down stream
Cause the life that lived is, is dead

And the wind screams Mary

Uh-will the wind ever remember the names it has blow in the past?
And with this crutch, its old age
And its wisdom it whispers, &quot;No, this will be the last&quot;

And the wind cries Mary
