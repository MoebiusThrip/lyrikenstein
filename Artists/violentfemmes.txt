I'm just like my father
but I am much worse 
he hurt his mother 
I hurt mine worse 
I'm just like my brother 
he hurt his wife 
I hurt mine first 
it hurts to be like Cain 
ain't no way 
I'm not able 
y'know what I mean 
he hurt my mother 
I hurt her worse 
never stop the 
never stopping

agamemnon
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/violentfemmes/agamemnon.html

The telephone, the telephone 
I have an idea 
Women always have ideas 
Hello... 
Here is Agamemnon 
Here is Agamemnon 
Who? Wrong connection 
This is... 
I am a moralist 
An anti-militarist 
I am against duels 
I cannot stand seeing 
A fly in rage 
I cannot look at 
A uniform or blood 
That woman has seduced me 
And now I am done for 
Darling, where shall I 
Hide you in a hurry? 
Here is Agamemnon 
Here is Agamemnon 
I am coming 
Directly from the trenches 
And look forward 
To a solemn luncheon 
Oh, my nerves 
I'm losing my find 
This damned telephone 
Spoils my favorite position 
And no I can start 
Writing poetry again
[end]
idanced
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/violentfemmes/idanced.html

I danced before I had two feet
Sang before I had a tongue. 
I laughed before I had two eyes. 
Loved before my heart was young. 
I swam before I had two hands 
and held the distance in my toes. 
Before I heard the stars I knew 
the wild compulsion of the rose. 
I bore the fruits of many lies. 
Before I came into this day. 
I knew before my grave was made, 
the worms eat only death away 
I danced before I had two feet

forbidden
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/violentfemmes/forbidden.html

come with us and play!
see, we have breasts as women!
from your tents by the sea
come play with us: it is forbidden

come with us and play!
lo, bare, straight legs in the water!
by our boats we stay
then swimming away
come to us: it is forbidden!

come with us and play!
see, we are as tall as women!
our eyes are keen:
our hair is bright:
our voices speak outright:
we revel in the sea's green!
come play: it is forbidden!

Beauty sat bathing by a spring where fairest shades did hide her...
The winds blew calm, the birds did sing, the cool streams ran beside her.
My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye to see what was forbidden,
But better memory said &quot;fie&quot; so vain desire was chidden.

Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.
Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.

Into a slumber then I fell when fond imagination,
Seemed to see but could not tell her feature or her fashion.
But e'vn as babes in dreams do smile and sometimes fall a-weeping,
So I awaked as wise this while as when I fell a-sleeping.

Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.
Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.

Say, man, are you down for doing something positive in the community?
No, I don't think I'll ever do that again.
Well, ain't you worried about doing the right thing?
Well, I don't care if I hey-nonny-nonny-nonny-ho-nonny-nonny-nonny...

Beauty sat bathing by a spring where fairest shades did hide her...
The winds blew calm, the birds did sing, the cool streams ran beside her.
My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye to see what was forbidden,
But better memory said &quot;fie&quot; so vain desire was chidden.

Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.
Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.

I've been following women all afternoon
I've been following women all afternoon
don't turn around 
too soon 
I've been following you all afternoon 
following you a fool in the full moon 
something's got a hold on me when I get a hold of you 
following women 
after dark 
nobody knows what's in my heart 
let your loving be 
I'm a lechery 
I do not spread leprosy 
I will not touch but let me see 
my building's burning down and i cannot breathe 
following you 
who won't believe 
perfect peace I cannot perceive 
when I'm following you I'm a fool in the full moon

nevertell
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/violentfemmes/nevertell.html

Hey, sister, have you heard?
Some people stand like trees without a word,
And what that means is that some people don't talk.

Oh, please, pardon me, mister.
You know I just didn't hear you that first time that you said that,
But now that you repeat for me, I'll be sure to do what I can.
You know I'm going to do what I can, do what I can, do-do-do-do what I can.
Gonna do what I can, do what I can, do-do-do-do what I can.
But no more, you understand?

Oh, please, pardon me, father.
You know, I just didn't hear you that, that first time that you said th...
Help me, help me, help me, help me, repeat it, repeat it, repeat it.
I'll be sure to do, do, do what I can.
Do what I can, do what I can, do, do, do, do what I can.
Gotta do what I can, do what I can, do, do, do, do what I can,
But no more, you understand?

It's of utmost importance, we're dealing with volatile substance.
I had so much on my mind. I was so glad when I died, oh...

Listen to me, baby, can you keep a secret for me?
Make sure no one finds out, 'cause then the lights will go out.
And I will find you out, and I will cut you up.
Uh-hmm, don't ask me why because I said I'm gonna do what I can,
Do what I can, do, do, do, do what I can.
Gotta do what I can, do what I can, do, do, do, do what I can.
But I'll have none of that, you understand?

Don't you know nothin'? You never tell on someone.
Don't you know nothin'? You ain't never going to tell on someone.

What you going to do? Gonna turn, gonna turn rat fink?
What you wanna do? Do want to see, do you wanna see what it's like to sink?
Sink down, sink down, sink down, down, down to the bottom of the river.
Sink down, sink, sink down, down, down, down, to the bottom of the river, sink, down, sink.
Sink down, down. Down, down to bottom of the river.
Sink down, sink, sink down, down. Down, down to the bottom of the river.

Don't you know no one? You never tell on someone.
Don't you know no one? You ain't never gonna tell on someone. 

Ah, ah, oh, I tell you what it's like, I tell you what it's like, oh.
I stood right up in the heart of Hell, I never tell.
I stood right up in the heart of Hell,
I'm never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell.
I'm never, never, never, never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell.
Nothing, nothing, never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell.
I'm never, never, never, never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell.
Nothing, nothing, never gonna tell, tell, tell, tell.
Ah...
