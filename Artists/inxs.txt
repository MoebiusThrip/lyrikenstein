Live baby live

Now that the day is over

I got a new sensation

In perfect moments

Impossible to refuse


Sleep baby sleep

Now that the night is over

And the sun comes like a god

Into our room

All perfect light and promises


Gotta hold on you

A new sensation

A new sensation

Right now

Gonna take you over

A new sensation

A new sensation


Dream baby dream

Of all that's come and going

And you will find out

In the end

There really is

There really is no difference


Cry baby cry

When you've got to get it out

I'll be your shoulder

You can tell me all

Don't keep it in ya

Well that's the reason why I'm here


Are you ready for a new sensation

A new sensation

Right now

Gonna take you on a new sensation

A new sensation


Hate baby hate

When there's nothing left for you

You're only human

What can you do

It'll soon be over

Don't let your pain take over you


Love baby love

It's written all over your face

There's nothing better we could do

Than live forever

Well that's all we've got to do


Hey now I'm gonna take a new sensation

A new sensation

dancingonthejetty

Watch the world argue

Argue with itself

Who's going to teach me

Peace and happiness


We could sit here forever

Just never get old

Listen to the world

Letting God's tyres down


Hit cities, sharp nights

Rag clothing

Dancing on the jetty


So our feet stay dry


Watch the world argue

Argue with themselves

Who's going to teach me

Peace and happiness


Watch the world argue

Argue with itself

Who's going to teach me

Peace and happiness


Blood is upon the steps

Two thousand years ago

Pray like hell then we go to fight

Another war in a holy land


Shot the world

True story

Snap decision

In a moment's glory


We're gonna watch them keeping it strong


Watch the world argue

Argue with itself

Who's going to teach me

Peace and happiness


Watch the world argue

Argue with itself

Who's going to teach me

Peace and happiness


We're making trouble

We change tracks

Fool the system

Take time to take notice


Hit city

Sharp nights

Rag clothing

Dancing on the Jetty


Watch the world argue

Argue with itself

Who's going to teach me

Peace and happiness


Watch the world argue

Argue with itself

Who's going to teach me

Peace and happiness

Could be clear black and white

Make a decision

Got a need inside and I don't know why

It's a strong feeling that grows and grows


One day - my life is out the door

Next day - you show me what it's for

One day - I think I know myself

Next day - you leave me on the shelf


New moment goes like this

Never forbidden

There's nothing to stop

The thief on time, stealing

The hours that keep you away


It rushes through my veins

Straight to my head

My mind is a planet

For you to roam


This is only just the start

It's the beginning

There's nothing to stop

The thief of time

Stealing the hours

That keep you away


One day - my life is out the door

Next day - you show me what it's for

One day - I think I know myself

Next day - you leave me on the shelf


In this house I call home

Living together

Got a need inside

And I don't know why

It's a strong

Feeling and it grows and grows


One day - my life is out the door

Next day - you show me what it's for

One day - I think I know myself

Next day - you leave me on the shelf


This is only just the start

It's the beginning


New moment goes like this

Never forbidden


Could be clear black and white

Make a decision

Back in time where fear can't climb

Warm and safe with a nursery rhyme

They will put your feet in very hot water

With your senses in a cloud you

Make them rich and very proud


All those years of learning

Just to learn again


No talk of love or jungle law

The tender heart we will ignore

And once again and once too often

The mislead aims of twisted teachers

Turns your life and face and features


I've come to see your honesty

Of ideal plans and security

Softly the voices are speaking to me

Your fault, son, that you've been done

Now your lessons have just begun

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry


When you're down and confused

Nothing seems right

And it's you who decides

Who's going to make it right


Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry


Well life ain't no joke

But it's good when you smile

Steal everything

But you won't get far


Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry


Sometimes you will fall

What cha gonna do?

Give your friend a call


Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry


We know that you can smile

Even though it takes a while

To lose your fears and say

Gonna lose your fears and say


Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry


Do you know who you are

And where you're going to

Don't you know that love

Gonna pull you

Gonna pull you through now baby


Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry


Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry. Baby don't cry


Face to face 

Anything is possible

Not political, or analytical

Never givin up on the wrong

You got a choice

Why don't you use it

Change, is an attitude

Guaranteed to take hold of you

So welcome, to the turnstile

Take a turn with a new vow 

Hey, I know what you know

All the sympathy

Made a mess of me

Respect the sacrifice

Before the number one

Now it has begun 


Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry

fairweatherahead
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/inxs/fairweatherahead.html

There's this place full of mountain heads

Living and chewing on the fat

Built upon the hazy plan

Like foundations slipping through the sand


Long teeth and whiskers like a rat

Fearing only those present

They got zero emotion

And everybody's fed up with that


Warm outside but very cold within

Followed and praised for many years

They got all the promotions

Isn't that the way it's always been


History's written always red

It's pages are painful and clear

It's so full of devotion

Makes you wonder where it could have led


Put the lights out, fair weather ahead

These strange new creatures

Aha, they won't be led

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry


I found you wanting

Like everyone

Always trying, happy lying

'Cos I'm no stranger to the ways of the world

I felt like crying

I felt like dying

We took a coffee, you took it so strong

Shaded from the neon

I could still see your eyes


Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby


Found in the gutter

With a knife in her back

Letter said sorry, please don't worry

She had a lover

With danger in his eyes

I tried to tell her

But she had the wildest heart


Show me, show me

Show me how

Show me, show me

Show me how

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry

Oh cherry baby

Oh cherry


Show me, show me

Show me how

Show me, show me
