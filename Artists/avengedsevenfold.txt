I slide through the wasteland that's my world

My hunger takes your life, preyed on to keep me alive, yeah

Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me


Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night

You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite


That's right I shed my skin tonight but my fangs are hard to hide

And you know that you're going to die, yeah

Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty to me


Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night

You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite

I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control

Fire that burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside


Making my way through the night you're still in my sight

You're running away cause you know you can't hide

My instincts are cold blooded hate; to you I'm the bearer of fate

Wrong place and now the wrong time, now terror is all that you'll find


Can't you feel the poison rising straight to the heart of the venomous bite

Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night

You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite

I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control

Fire that burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside


Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone

Vanish from my sights - venomous control

You won't make it right - my appetite has grown

Lost the final fight - no love will be shown


Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone

Vanish from my sights - venomous control

You can't make it right - my appetite has grown

Lost the final fight - no love will be shown

Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own

Don't you see I am your pride,
Agent of wealth,
Bearer of needs? (And you know it's right)
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be

Now you know I am your pride,
Agent of wealth,
Bearer of needs. (And you know it's right)
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Harden your mind through the chains of the divine
Make way for the shepherd of fire

Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late

I am your pride,
Agent of wealth,
Bearer of needs. (And you know it's right)
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak

I am your wrath.
I am your guilt.
I am your lust. (And you know it's right)
I am your law.
I am your star.
I am your trust.

Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

Cry alone, I've gone away

No more nights, no more pain

I've gone alone, took all my strength

I've made the change,

I won't see you tonight


Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood

All the ones around me

I cared for and loved


It's building up inside of me

A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free

Don't mourn for me, 

You're not the one to place the blame

As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight


Sorrow sank deep inside my blood 

All the ones around me

I cared for and most of all I loved

But I can't see myself that way

Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away


Cry alone, I've gone away

No more nights, no more pain

I've gone alone, took all my strength

But I've made the change,

I won't see you tonight


So far away, I'm gone. 

Please don't follow me tonight

And while I'm gone everything will be alright


No more breath inside

Essence left my heart tonight

No more breath inside

Essence left my heart tonight

Come back to me, this is unconceivable

Breaking apart the ones you love

Hate runs deep for what you've done to us

Left alone through suicide...suicide


I just want to die, take away my life

lay by your side, please...


Come back to me, this is unconceivable

Breaking apart the ones you love

Hate runs deep for what you've done to us

Left alone through suicide


Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare

No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.

He's gone. Nothing will take back time.

I need him back, but nothing will take back time.


I can see just fine with you in my life,

there by my side as it starts to fade

I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream

a nightmare full of sorrow


Nightmare - full of pain 
[x2]


I look back and see the twisted road

Best friends and despair took its toll


Take away 
[x4]


Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood

all the ones around me, I cared for

and most of all I loved

but I can't see myself that way

please don't forget me

or cry while I'm away


Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare

No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.

He's gone. Nothing will take back time.

I need him back, but nothing will take back time.


I can see just fine with you in my life,

there by my side as it starts to fade

I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream

a nightmare full of sorrow

Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets, now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore

Royal flames will carve a path in chaos,
Bringing daylight to the night
Death is riding into town with armor,
They've come to take all your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The King...

Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne
Born again, but it's too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid

Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light (light)
Death is riding into town with armor,
They've come to grant you your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The King...


[Solo]

There's a taste of fear (hail, hail, hail)
When the henchmen call (hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to tame the land (hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to claim it all

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king!

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!

Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight, on tonight

Ooooo....
Stand up and fight

The fighting rages on and on, to challenge me you must be strong
I walk your land but don't belong, two million soldiers can't be wrong

It's no fun but I've been here before
I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war
(Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things)
Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother right in front of her son
(Take this from my consciousness, and please erase my dreams)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to God that our side is right
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears
Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry
Unless I don't return tonight

So many soldiers on the other side, I take their lives so they can't take mine
(Scared to make it out alive now murder's all I know)
Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here
I have my weapons so there's nothing to fear
(Another day, another life, but nothing real to show for)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to God that our side is right
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears
Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry
Unless I don't return tonight

Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight

Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive
Stranger's blood on my hands, I have shot all I can
There are no silent nights, watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me
No thought of me, no thought of me

Ohhhhh.....

Walk the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your street tonight
Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young
Fought so scared in the name of God and country
[end]
walk
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avengedsevenfold/walk.html

Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence

One step from lashing out at you...

You want in to get under my skin

And call yourself a friend

I've got more friends like you

What do I do?


[Pre:]

Is there no standard anymore?

What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong

You can't be something you're not

Be yourself, by yourself

Stay away from me

A lesson learned in life

Known from the dawn of time


[Chorus:]

Respect, walk

What did you say?

Respect, walk

Are you talking to me?


Are you talking to me?


Run your mouth when I'm not around

It's easy to achieve

You cry to weak friends that sympathize

Can you hear the violins playing your song?

Those same friends tell me your every word


[Pre]


[Chorus x2]


Are you talking to me?

No way, punk!


[Chorus x2]


Are you talking to me?

Walk on home, boy

nightmare
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avengedsevenfold/nightmare.html

Nightmare!
(Now your nightmare comes to life)

Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
(Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
And old acquaintance severed
(Burn the world your last endeavor)

Flesh is burning
You can smell it in the air
Cause men like you have
Such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while
They ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave
Until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness,
Turning, haunting, yearning
Pull the trigger

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

(While your nightmare comes to life)

Can't wake up in sweat
'Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons
(Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
(Loathing self-assassination)

You've been lied to
Just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve
To tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they
Medicate your brain
And while you slowly
Go insane they tell ya
&quot;Given with the best intentions
Help you with your complications&quot;

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare


[M. Shadows laughing]

Fight (fight)
Not to fail (fail)
Not to fall (fall)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (die)
Die again (die)
Drenched in sin (sin)
With no respect for another

Oh

Down (down)
Feel the fire (fire)
Feel the hate (hate)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (lost)
Hit the wall (wall)
Watch you crawl (crawl)
Such a replaceable liar

And I know you hear their voices
Calling from above
And I know they may seem real
These signals of love
But our life's made up of choices
Some without appeal
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal

(As your nightmare comes to life)

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

alittlepieceofheaven
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/avengedsevenfold/alittlepieceofheaven.html

Before the story begins, is it such a sin,
For me to take what's mine, until the end of time
We were more than friends, before the story ends,
And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long,
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong,
Before the possibilities came true,
I took all possibility from you

Almost laughed myself to tears,
(Ha hahahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
I can't believe it,
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it

She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in
It goes on and on and on,
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever,
With a fountain spray on your youth whenever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime,
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered,
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave,
To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it

(Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime,
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry


[Maniacal laughter]

I will suffer for so long
(What will you do, not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, If it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing
(You fucking bitch)


[Maniacal laughter]

&quot;Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?&quot;
&quot;Yes, I do&quot;
&quot;Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?&quot;
&quot;I do&quot;
&quot;I now pronounce you...&quot;

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time
But bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry

You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime,
We fell apart, let's make a new start, oh,
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry
[end]
