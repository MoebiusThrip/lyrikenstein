paranoid
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/paranoid.html

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind

people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy

Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify


Can you help me occupy my brain?

Oh yeah


I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find

I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind


Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry

Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal


And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state

I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
[end]
ironman
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/ironman.html

Has he lost his mind?

Can he see or is he blind?

Can he walk at all,

Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?

Has he thoughts within his head?

We'll just pass him there

why should we even care?


He was turned to steel

in the great magnetic field

When he travelled time

for the future of mankind


Nobody wants him

He just stares at the world

Planning his vengeance

that he will soon unfurl


Now the time is here

for Iron Man to spread fear

Vengeance from the grave

Kills the people he once saved


Nobody wants him

They just turn their heads

Nobody helps him

Now he has his revenge


Heavy boots of lead

fills his victims full of dread

Running as fast as they can

Iron Man lives again!
[end]
neversaydie
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/neversaydie.html

People going nowhere, taken for a ride

Looking for the answers that they know inside

Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme

Snow White's mirror said &quot;partners in crime!&quot;


Don't they ever have to worry?

Don't you ever wonder why?

It's a part of me that tells you

Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die

Never, never, never say die again


Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry

Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie

All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go

Hold back, `till it's ready, taking it slow


Don't they ever have to worry?

Don't you ever wonder why?

It's a part of me that tells you

Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die

Never, never, never say die again


Don't you ever say die

Don't you ever say die

Never say die


Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall

Children get together, you can save us all

Future's on the corner, throwing us a die

Slow down, turn around, everything's fine


There's no need to have a reason

There's no need to wonder why

It's a part of me that tells you

Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die

Never, never, never say die again

handofdoom
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/handofdoom.html

What you gonna do? Time's caught up with you

Now you wait your turn, you know there's no return

Take your written rules, you join the other fools

Turn to something new, now it's killing you


First it was the bomb, Vietnam napalm

Disillusioning, you push the needle in

From life you escape, reality's that way

Colours in your mind satisfy your time


Oh you, you know you must be blind

To do something like this

To take the sleep that you don't know

You're giving Death a kiss,

Oh, little fool now


Your mind is full of pleasure

Your body's looking ill

To you it's shallow leisure

So drop the acid pill, don't stop to think now


You're having a good time baby

But that won't last

Your mind's all full of things

You're living too fast

go out enjoy yourself

Don't bottle it in

You need someone to help you

To stick the needle in, yeah


Now you know the scene, your skin starts turning green

Your eyes no longer seeing life's reality

Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin

Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin


Head starts spinning 'round, you fall down to the ground

Feel your body heave, Death's hands starts to weave

It's too late to turn, you don't want to learn

Price of life you cry, now you're gonna die!

thelawmaker
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/thelawmaker.html

The horizon breaks, where a figure stands

Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command


[CHORUS]

He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name

He's not here for deliverance, no

He's the Lawmaker


He newer speaks, but his task we're told

To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold


[CHORUS]


Silver mountains won't save you from hell

The prince of darkness inside you will dwell

Oh your weakness your past

The Lawmaker comes


[CHORUS]


He's the Lawmaker

timemachine
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/timemachine.html

Oh what are you gonna do

When there's a part of you

That needs to run with the wind


And the fire of burning yesterdays

Can only light the way

To lead you from

The garden of the dark

Stay out of shadows


Now look like the change is on

Tomorrow's never gone

Today just never comes


Go on and jump,yeah

Into the hurricane

You will forger the pain

It's only there

To exorcise your mind


Looking at the world

When you've open up your eyes

You've got to see the promises they've made

They're bloody lies and broken dreams

Your silence screams


[Chorus:]

You're living in a time machine

And you can choose just who you are

Someone that you've never seen

Somewhere you've never been

You're living in a time machine


Oh what are you gonna do

When every part of you

Just needs to catch the wind


And the fire of burning yesterdays

Can only light the way

To lead you from

The garden of the dark


Looking for the world

When you've opened up your eyes

You'll see you've got invisible chains

They're only lies

Not what it seems

I hear your silent screams


[Chorus:]

You're living in a time machine

Nobody cares just where you go

Taken where you've never been

?? somewhere you don't know


You're living in a time machine

Why do you stay who you are

Be what you've never been

Someone you've never seen

You're living in a time machine

Yeah

endofthebeginning
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/endofthebeginning.html

Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?

Reanimation of the sequence
Rewind the future to the past.
To find the source of the solution;
The system has to be recast.

Release your mind.
Fast forward to the secrets of your code.
Your life's on overload.
Delete or save

The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know
Which way to go

You may be lost and confused
A second chance your turn to lose

Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul.
Transforming time and space beyond control;
Rise up  resist and be the master of your fate.
Don't look back live for today - tomorrow is too late.

You don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free.

Alright-okay alright till they set you free...
Alright-okay till they set you free, free, free, free
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah
[end]
loner
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/loner.html

He's just a loner
He never says hello
A friend to no one
He's got no place to go

He don't look happy
He look through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing
No one to sympathize

Alright now

He hides himself away
His secrets not revealed
As life just passes by he keeps himself concealed

A solitary man
An enigmatic child
A riddle never solved
A prisoner exiled

Alright now

I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate

Come on yeah

Has he ever tried to be happy?
Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting too late to recover
He won't stand a chance and into his own hell he'll descend

Don't descend 
[x4]

No understanding of things we already know
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go

Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead

Come on yeah
[end]
lukeswallwarpigs
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/lukeswallwarpigs.html

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds... Oh Lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role to the poor, yeah

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'till their Judgment day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more war pigs of the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh Lord yeah!

fairieswearboots

Goin' home, late last night

Suddenly I got a fright

Yeah I looked through a window and surprised what I saw

Fairy wear boots and dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!


Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me

Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me

I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, all right now!


Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me

Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me

I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, all right now!


So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me

He said &quot;Son, son, you've gone too far.

`cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do.&quot;

Yeah......

zeitgeist
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blacksabbath/zeitgeist.html

Astral engines in reverse
I'm falling through the universe again
Down among a deadmen's vision
Faded dreams and nuclear fission spent

The strings of theory are holding up the race
The puppets falling to the ground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found
On this sinking ship I travel

Faster than the speed of light
Not so supernova burns
The black holes turn and fade from sight
The strings of theory hide in the human race
The answers buried underground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time, I wonder will my ship be found

And very soon
The Bomber's moon
Will show us light
And as we crash
We'll pray and kiss
And say goodnight
Goodnight

We sail through endless skies

stars shine like eyes

the black night sighs

The moon in silver trees

falls down in tears

light of the night

The earth, a purple blaze

of sapphire haze

in orbit always


While down below the trees

bathed in cool breeze

silver starlight breaks down the night

And so we pass on by the crimson eye

of great god Mars

as we travel the universe

What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my pain
Icicles within my brain
(cocaine)

Something blowing in my head
Winds of ice that soon will spread
Down to freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

My eyes are blind but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me

Let the winter sunshine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Build my dreams on flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow

Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one that's really the loser
This is where I feel I belong

Kiss the world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?

Long ago I wandered through my mind

In the land of fairy tales and stories

Lost in happiness I had no fears

Innocence and love was all I knew

Was it illusion?


Soon the days went passing into years

Happiness just didn't come so easy

Life was born of fairy tales and daydreams

Innocence was just another word

Was it illusion?


Lost in the wheels of confusion

Running through furnace of tears

Eyes full of angered illusion

Hiding in everyday fears


So I found that life is just a game

But you know there's never been a winner

Try your hardest, just to be a loser

The world will still be turning when you're gone

Yeah when you're gone!
