[Intro]
It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby


[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars

She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir

&quot;There's nothin' wrong with lovin' who you are&quot;
She said, &quot;Cause he made you perfect, babe&quot;
&quot;So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say&quot;


[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way


[Post-chorus]
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be!


[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth

In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth

A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M (hey hey hey)
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (love needs faith)


[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way


[Post-chorus]
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born-
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way


[Bridge]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby you were born this way

No matter gay, straight, or bi,
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track baby
I was born to be brave


[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way


[Post-chorus]
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way
Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way


[Outro]
I was born this way hey!
I was born this way hey!
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way hey!

I was born this way hey!
I was born this way hey!
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way hey!

We are the crowd
We're coming out
Got my flash on it's true
Need that picture of you
It's so magical
We'd be so fantastic, oh

Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us
It don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that baby I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be your
Papa-Paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi

I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and return
My lashes are dry - purple teardrops I cry
It don't have a price
Loving you is Cherry Pie
'Cause you know that baby I
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be your
Papa-Paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Real good, We're dancing in the studio
Snap, snap, to that shit on the radio
Don't stop, for anyone
We're plastic but we still have fun

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
Baby there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be your
Papa-Paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ladygaga/telephone.html

[Lady Gaga:]
Hello, hello, baby, you called?
I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breakin' up on me
Sorry I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy
Kinda busy
Kinda busy
Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy

Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy

Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor

Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy
(I'm busy)
Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone


[Beyonce:]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer


[Lady Gaga:]
Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing


[Beyonce:]
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'
I'll be dancin'
I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'


[2x]
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop callin'
Stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dancefloor

Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy
(I'm busy)
Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone


[3x]
My telephone
My, my, my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

We're sorry, we're sorry
The number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number or try your call again

Want you in my rear window
Baby you're sick

You know that I want you
('Cause I'm a free bitch baby!)
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, bad romance

I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!)
I want your love and
All your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas

Judas! Judaas Judas! Judaas
Judas! Judaas Judas! GAGA

When he comes to me I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown


[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby he's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby he's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas

Judas! Judaas Judas! Judaas
Judas! Judaas Judas! GAGA

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his crooked way
I've learned love is like a brick you can
Build a house or sink a dead body

I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown


[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby he's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby he's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas


[Bridge]
Ew
In the most Biblical sense,
I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute wench, vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me if offenced,
Or wear an ear condom next time

I wanna love you,
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue,
Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to


[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby he's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby he's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas

Ohohohoh
I'm in love with Judas

Judas! Judaas Judas! Judaas
Judas! Judaas Judas! GAGA

I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you (won't look at you)
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

Stop
Please, just let me go
Alejandro
Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad
Just like a dad
And all those flames that
Burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight
Gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Alejandro
Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Al-e-jan-dro
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Bye Fernando
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette, hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto
