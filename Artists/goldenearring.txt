radarlove
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldenearring/radarlove.html

I've been drivin' all night,
My hand's wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head
That drives my heel
It's my baby callin',
Says: I need you here
And it's a half past four
And I'm shifting gear

When she is lonely
And the longing gets too much
She sends a cable
Coming in from above
Don't need a phone at all

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a wave in the air,
Radar Love

The radio's playing some forgotten song
Brenda Lee's &quot;Coming On Strong&quot;
The road has got me hypnotized
And I'm speeding into a new sunrise

When I get lonely,
And I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort,
Comin' in from above
Don't need a letter at all

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky,
Radar Love

No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow

And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's &quot;Coming On Strong&quot;
And the newsman sang his same song
One more radar love is gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort, coming in from above
We don't need no letter at all

We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a line in the sky
We've got a thing that's called Radar Love
We've got a thing that's called,
Radar Love

twilightzone
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/goldenearring/twilightzone.html

(somewhere in a lonely hotel room,
There's a guy starting to realize
That eternal fate has turned its back on him,
It's two a.m...........)

It's two a.m., the fear has gone
I'm sittin' here waitin', the gun still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances
Yeah there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
I'm wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
I cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I've gone too far
Help I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I've gone too far
Soon you will come to know,
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know, when the bullet hits the bone

I'm falling down a spiral, destination unknown
A double-crossed messenger, all alone
I can't get no connection, can't get through, where are you
Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
And when the hit man comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

Help I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I've gone too far
Help I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I've gone too far
Soon you will come to know, when the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know, when the bullet hits the bone

Wake up in the morning, glad to be alive
My heart's on fire and I'm shaking
All I want is a little peace and quiet
Stop me from going crazy yeah
Stumble to the kitchen
Flashin' back on last night
Gotta get to work, I'll never make it
I was hungry for action
I saw her standing there
Looking like a bomb in a basement, Yeah
She said: Hey there stranger, wanna walk into my life?
Treat a woman right, get in on tonight

Do you want to?
And I want and I want you to give it
Give it all you got, give it all it takes
Give it all you got and don't fake it

Anything you want, I never get enough
Give it all you got
And Joe you better stop all you're thinkin'
Stop thinking 'bout tomorrow tonight
Joe, you better stop all your dying 
Stop dying to get home alive

Faster than a bullet, hotter than a gun
Like a shootin' star, I've been chasin'
I was ripping off her jacket, magic in my hands
She told me to relax and embrace her, Yeah

She said: Cool it little sinner
Got a big appetite, treat a woman right
Never get enough of your never ending love

I wanna go ahead until I just run out of gas
We gotta beat the road with four-wheel thunder
There's a Cadillac dealer in Kansas City counting money
And the highway patrol ain't going nowhere

Don't say no, don't say no, don't make me grieve
Don't say no, don't say no, you gotta feel the breeze

On a clear night yeah, moonlight yeah
You and me and the car
Under a thousands stars
Clear night yeah, moonlight yeah
That's all the magic we need
So, don't you go turnin' my dream into a nightmare

Come on honey, let's ride right out of here
Imagine you and I, leavin' it all behind
Find another world, beyond the turnpike
There'll be lots of people uptight
Maybe some FBI, and your daddy screamin' bloody murder

Don't say no, don't say no, don't make me grieve
Don't say no, don't say no, you gotta feel the breeze

On a clear night yeah, moonlight yeah 
You and me and the car
Under a thousands stars
Clear night yeah, moonlight yeah
That's all the magic we need
So, don't you go turnin' my dream into a nightmare

Come on honey, let's ride right out of here
Picture the two of us, we're so happy, so much in love
You know how the story goes
At the end of the rainbow
There's a bag of gold

People talkin'
Tryin' to break us up
Why don't they let us be?
Sticks and stones might break my bones
But talk don't bother me
People talkin'
Tryin' to break us up
I know I love you so
I don't care what people say
I'll never never let you go
I've been abused in my heart
I've been accused
I've been rebuked and I've been stalked
People talkin'
Tryin' to break us up
You know they're tryin' to blacken my name
They'll say anything there is to make me feel bad
Anything to make me shame
People talkin'
Tryin' to break us up
Why won't they let us be?
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But talk don't bother me

Woman, you're an avalanche of love
Falling over me means I can't get you off
Woman you're an avalanche of love
Loving you means I'm under, you're above
We're getting loose tonight
It's gonna be alright
We'll paint the town red
Until the night is dead
We're gonna have a ball
We dance and rock and roll
We shake it all night long
Until we can't go on
But you'll fall in love, I mean
When I'm somewhere wasting on the floor

Woman you're an avalanche of soul
Rolling over me you shine out heat instead of cold
Woman you're an avalanche of soul
Lovin' you the way I do is lovin' hot coal

We're getting loose tonight
It's gonna be alright
We'll paint the town red
Until the night is dead
We're gonna have a ball
We dance and rock and roll
We shake it all night long
Until we can't go on
And you'll fall in love, I mean
When I'm somewhere wasting on the floor

I walk 47 miles of barbed-wire
Wear a cobra snake for a neck-tie
Got a brand new house built on a hill
Made out a rattle snake hide
I got a great big chimney way on the top
Made out of human skulls
So come on over here, you cute little thing
And tell me now, who do you love
Who do you love, who do you love

A voodoo man, he took me by the hand
He said: woo baby, I can understand
Crushed a bone on a ju-ju stone
Rolled his eyes and he cast a spell
Said: who do you love
Who do you love, who do you love, who do you love

The light was black and the night was blue
And down the alley I crept on through
A shot of a pistol, somebody screamed
You should a heard just what I seen
Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you love, who do you love

I got a tombstone head and a graveyard mind
I'm just twenty-two and I ain't stole a dime
Got the eyes of a wolf, and a gator smile
I lived long enough, and I don't mind dyin'
Who do you love, who do you love
Who do you love, who do you love
[end]
