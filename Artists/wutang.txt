[bees buzzing]


[Prodigal Sunn:]
Ladies and gentlemen: Sunz of Man
Uhh, Jungle of Concrete
yo, yo


[Chorus: x4]
In the jungle, we gotta rumble with the bees/wee
Ain't nothin sweet, we gotta eat


[Timbo King:]
Yo, we come from starvin days, runnin up in Dr. J's
Rock away, so the mega trades, diggin, pockin days
Yo, the aids wasn't in, calm braids all trimmed
Army suits snatched and Timbs
You'se a friend, snatch a gem


[Prodigal Sunn:]
I spent a lifetime of doin crime, hustlin dimes, guzzlin wine
Smugglin wives, one of a kind
Under the sunshine, movin as one mind, the genuine
Star child, Allah's style, many say their barber's wild
When I element the foul, prowl, upon the weekend of sweet
I gotta eat, generate with the heat, demolish beats
Collectin sheets, war with beast, Islamic warrior
Livin the mass hysteria, the bomb shell of America
Swell competors, explicit lyrics from the editor
Realistic predator, the rhyme writer, climb heights
Rhymes ignite, MC's reputation, blown out of sight
On the mic device, my crew get nice, shoot dice
Doin callistetics, young diplomatics with automatics
The asiatic, fuck a fanatic, I split his attic
You don't want no static, I make you carriage for the rabbits


[Chorus x2]


[Hell Razah:]
We've got to take what we want, let these others rappers front
Yo, take that, you ain't goin get it laid back
Best record what I say, ain't no time to playback
That's right platinum hits, yo, before the age at
Gather millions, acapella in the streets, today crack
Fuck opinions, I'm hittin to the nights endin
A new beginin, takin over men and women
Thoughts used for sinnin, neighborhood no grinin
Thug religions, expeditions, startin for a mil
Stick the student for his intuition
Beyond college, street knowledge, got to eat knowledge
Off the tree of life, while seek wallets
Credit cards, some trust for their gods
In the Wizard of Oz, you get it all to get robbed
Price is on the food and the Earth's precious jewels
Ain't the golden rules from the golden black jewels
Steppin out the furnace, only run with fast learners
Burn cash and we stash burners
We be the underground childs, mainstream now
Sort of like Apocalypse, bloaw, blaow
Take what you own, must return to your home
Claim back your throne, we're on a higher zone
Black Lazurus, plus we're not havin it
Pass the diamonds on the wrist, we're on some take the earth shit
Demolish every tool, that y'all niggaz work with
The barcode, bio chips be short circuited


[62nd Assassin:]
Here in this jungle, jungle, jungle ?
I'm livin through, your crew on the subject
The loot, I'm new improved
Plus my time piece is bullet proof
I need a bulldozer or crane, that stains like in vain
You be the blood and I be the drainin on
Forgot to burn your proper on, with the tool stone
Written, founded dead on this spot
You emergin, believe I'm the surgeon
Rhymes leave your brain on all right, double scenes
Back hand, slap you, clap thoughts, like evil raps
Play that, what it slap right back
You was seen, soak the zeen
Self esteem, so common, even suckers die
Major League, total assassinator, rhyme complicator
The devil and the sword bring death, feed Jamaica
Rain or hurricane, step on my house
Into the house on severe pain, strong like a pyramid
Nothin but various parts of the house that Jack built
The little house on the praire, I huff and I puff
And I blow your brain to a seisure
Before you step to me, you should of called off
Ceaser's father, mercy words, I'm no joke
I cancer smoke, I reply, &quot;your brain and told&quot;
I live for my tech 9, uzi, grenade, all cause of one rhyme
Better believe, sleeves, I buck you chicken
Make you love us, my mic around your neck to bug it


[Chorus x4]


[various talk to fade]

holdtheheater
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wutangclan/holdtheheater.html

[Intro - RZA:]
Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head


[Hook x2:]
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw


[Verse 1 - Cappadonna:]
How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television


[Verse 2 - U-God:]
Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'm a die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here


[Hook x2]


[Bridge - RZA:]
Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick


[Verse 3 - GZA:]
Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter


[Hook x2]


[Verse 4 - Method Man:]
Overachiever, power hungry overeater
I95, whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
I got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers
My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha, Mr. Meth


[Hook x2]

Mommy... Daddy...
It's the Killa Beez....


[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


[U-God:]
Yo yo
I was born with this magnet, warned by the dragnet
About my dirty habits, I got to have it, the super-glow
Deuce Bigelow - Male Gigolo
Gold hands crush Coke cans and Michelobs
Style is Nino, black Benzito, Valentino
Nine needles - voice; evil steelo
Hit, like the bull, more pull than Magneto
Crush kilos with my bare hand, reload the Eagle
Nine dirty strikes, leaped up off all you people
Burn therapy, chemo, seap hoes
See you through the peephole - in the crime lab
Countin Ginos, cut-tin dime slabs
Then he bagged up Chino, rushed through the crowd with a hee-ho
Slapshots, jackpots, and pe-nnals
Throw graffiti on the wall, throwin up Reemo
Gambino three dice, headcrack Cee-Lo
In ya earhole, let the snare roll go low
Lower than low, lower than zero
Who's your rhymin heroes? *heavy breathing*
(&quot;Killa beeeeeeeeeeees?&quot;)


[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


[Bobby Digital:]
Bzzzz.. you hear the hornet, you ducks don't want it
I dogs blast turbo, supersonic
Hats off, welcome back, whipe the sweat off
Bobby Digital, half-man and half-cyborg
NY City, home of the fly bitties
With high-heel shoes and tattoos on side titties
Shorties swallow up the apple cider
Ra' doin a buck forty in the yellow Spyder
With the black interior, my mack superior
to your theory of gats, up in the cafeteria
I used to cut class and bang lunch tables
With four finger weaves and long chunky gold cables
Now I'm known to smack drum machines, carry +Guillotines+
Watch my bullets scream (&quot;Pheeewwwwww!&quot;) and hit the target
You can't trace the path of air for Richard Starlett


[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious


[Inspectah Deck:]
It's the return of the bad boy, the mic Sean Penn
Floss gems across the globe with my nine Sourceman
At a speed that excedes your convertible Benz
From a distance you glimpse, supernocular lens
Stay hotter than a ex-con dodgin the pens
Killa Squadron, known to start a popular trend
And the emblem, symbolize the wisdom
certifies the platinum, magnifies the stardom
Shots bust at random, wake you out your boredom
Kings of our kindom, reppin from our hoodlums
Gotta whip them problems, cuz yo we step on toes
Bangin heads knockin teeth loose, welcome to the pros
Flash quiz, do that nigga handle his biz?
I spin a song like Michael and Diana in the Wiz
The rough shit, I bust it for the republic
Government, you ain't lovin it, whatchu fuckin wit?
Manifesto, light it like a techno club
Outside I don't expect no love
Man this grip, make the fans flip, don't chance it
Cop the goods, while my hundred hoods run rampid


[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious
You're no warrior, ya can't bang like us
You're no warrior, ya not so devious

[ShaCronz:]
What... I got bullets that'll touch your brain
It takes nothing for me to fuck your dame
Remember me from &quot;Hatin' Don't Pay&quot;, pa, nothing's change
Pushing heavyweights, still weighing a buck and change
Soaking wet, rock whole diamonds, no cuts in the chains
Let's get the jumped off jumped off, where the chicks at?
You see a nigga with a nice 'what', nigga get that
Young rich cat, pitch crack, you against me is a missmatch
I spit murder, and sip canteens, back like six gats, so what up homey
You out of luck homey, still don't give a fuck, homey
Ride with the heat on me, in a big truck, homey
Cadillac, Escalades, you still getting stuck, homey
Got clientele like a weed spot, henny'd up
Creep blocks, with the heat cocked
Semi's bust, after that, all beef stop


[Ghostface Killah:]
 &quot;Wanting respect... &quot;


[Chorus: Freemurda (ShaCronz)]
Catch cars on the interstate
Move heroin, on the interstate
Heat toke cars on the interstate
ShaCronz gonna win this case, crawls all on his face
He pour Don on this bitch's face
(What is it?) This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
(What is it?) Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga
(What is it?) This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
(What is it?) Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga


[ShaCronz:]
Don't give a fuck who you are, my crew get down and murder ya
Change positions, move around like furniture
Inviting all hoes, you can slide with me
Party with Tory, or ride with Free
Peep the scenery, you know who my team be
Light reefer, know how to deuce on the green bee
With wife beaters, fuck envy's, don't like cheaters
If I can't get in, with my sweats and Timbs
I'm a hood nigga, I live in the projects with a Benz
Ain't like ya average rap nigga, still keeping gats, niggaz
Post up like Shaq, on the block, with crack niggaz
Spin ones, all that, and then some
Turn, shoot, shot in your face, and one


[Freemurda:]
This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga
This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga


[Chorus]
