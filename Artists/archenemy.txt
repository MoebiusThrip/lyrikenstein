bridgeofdestiny
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/bridgeofdestiny.html

Standing at the bridge of destiny
So long since I tasted fear
Lurking in the darkest holes
Awaiting my minds weakest moment
Old words from an old world
Against the laws of nature
They say the truth is overrated
Wall of anger corrupts my thought

Standing at the bridge of destiny
Show me a sign
On the verge of losing my sanity
Free my soul

My inner demons torture me
Flapping their wings in my face
Damn you! You twisted illusion
I am no longer afraid
See through their liquid souls
Evil eyes that will hypnotize
You can no longer hurt me
I am my own worst enemy

Unleash the trapped souls of the dead
Spirits since long forgotten
Guardians for the lost faith
Destined for glory?
Watch them all turn into sand
And the wind blow them away
Wisdom pours into my soul
...endlessly...
[end]
asthepagesburn
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/asthepagesburn.html

As the pages burn
Secrets can't be unlearned,
Silence can't be unheard.
Knowledge is burden,
Power is onus,
As the pages burn.
Your memories fade 
Freed from the gap of reality,
Rejecting cognition 
As the pages burn.
Sinking in a pool of ether,
The past is washed clean.

Rip apart the world,
Word by word, inch by inch.
Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience.

Sweet amnesia
Here to free you
As the pages burn.
All your trials
Solved by fire
As the pages burn.

As the smoke fills the room,
Soon to pass, heavy gloom.
The wind will whisk away the past,
A blank pages stares at you.
Nothing left
Where to start?
A second chance carries expectation
The books you'd written no longer exist
The future is in your pen,
Ink to paper, now begin.

Rip apart the world,
Word by word, inch by inch.
Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience.

Sweet amnesia
Here to free you
As the pages burn.
All your trials
Solved by fire
As the pages burn.

Rewriting history
Starting now
Erase the misery,
Let the flames
Eat your doubts.

Sweet amnesia
Here to free you
As the pages burn.
All your trials
Solved by fire
As the pages burn.
[end]
avalanche
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/avalanche.html

A fistful of fear in my hands
A bullet of betrayal in my brain
No progress comes from pleasure
We smile in ignorance and learn in pain

Willful deceit was your plan
Desperately avoid the blame
Who will you answer to now?
Sharpened your shovels
Just to dig your grave

Stand up because the ground is in your way
I won't give you any piece
Yet still you talk
Try to fight but I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

Sick, sick, sick
I'm sick of being your martyr
Your inglated ego is just dead weight
Bask in all the eyes upon you
Before you know it
The'll have turned away

Stand up as the whole world turns away
I won't give you any peace
Yet still you talk
Try to fight but I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

Wait and see
Cry yourself a lonesome creek

Your decaying corpse
Can feed the roots
Of my towering free

Just wait and see
You're dead to me

Yet still you speak
Trying to justify what you're doing to me

I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you
What did you expect?

instinct
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/instinct.html

The more I see - the less I believe
The more I hear - the less I care
This world we've created, has left me cold
This world is sedated, dying in it's sleep

I feel nothing

Seen it written on a thousand faces
The simple truth we fear
Seen it happen in a thousand places
Instinct brought us here

The more I see - the less I believe
The more I hear - the less I care
We used to be the chosen ones
Second to none
Look at what we've become
A pathetic excuse for life

I feel nothing

I can feel nothing
Nothing at all
Except for the pain
That hits me again
[end]
existtoexit
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/existtoexit.html

Living in the shadows
Crawling in the dark
Another face - you will never see
Another voice - you will never hear

Erase my mortal shell
To feed my dying soul
Morbid glory shines on me
I will leave my mark

You will know
When I go
You will see
Exist to exit

Suicide - Escape oblivion
Kiss the blade of sharp, cold steel
The perfect day for my final exit
Hold your breath when I die

Art, action, reincarnation
Evolution through ritual death
Reborn as an infamous legend
Forever immortal, post-mortem fame
[end]
downtonothing
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/downtonothing.html

The light dwindles down to nothing
As the candle sputters out
Just beyond the abb and flow
Of a dark and restless heart

Alone again
Facing the demons
In this hell
Of my own making

I will not let this moment
Define who I am
Now you see me
Now you don't
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me
Now you don't

Licking the wounds now
I shelter in the melody
My ink runs from black to red
Screaming into the void

Alone again
Facing the demons
In this hell
Of my own making

I will not let this moment
Define who I am
Now you see me
Now you don't
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me
Now you don't

Seemingly endless
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return

Seemingly endless
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return

nemesis
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/nemesis.html

We walk this Earth
With fire in our hands
Eye for an eye
We are Nemesis

We are with you
Countless vicious souls
Fight! - Fighting for freedom
United we stand

We are legion
Voice of anarchy
This is revolution
Creating new disorder

We are enemy
Opponent of the system
Crushing hypocrisy
Slaying the philistine

One for all - All for one
We are strong - We are one
Nemesis

A malicious fever burns
In our hearts, In our veins
Your blood, My blood
All blood runs the same

[Lead - Christopher]

At the mercy of our conscience
Confined within our fate
Never really questioned why
We are refugees in a dying world

To become a part of the end

Are we the ones, the ones to blame?
We are mortals of shadows and dust


[Lead melody - Michael]

The sun sets on our sinking ship of fools
On our journey into oblivion
We ask ourselves again and again
Now will we be remembered


[Lead - Michael]

Shadows...
And dust...

savagemessiah
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/savagemessiah.html

Meet your maker
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix to the sky
So intense, so glorious...

Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great lawgiver
So high and mighty

The immaculate deception
A taker of life
With unbridled aggression
Striking down on the disbelievers

Savage - Messiah
Take us higher
Savage - Messiah
Take us now!

Blessed in blood
We are reborn in hate
Thousands of spirits cry
So intense, so glorious...

Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great Messiah
So high and mighty

Tear down the walls
Wake up the world
Ignorance is not bliss
So fed up with second best
Our time is here and now

I am the enemy
I am the antidote
Watch me closely
I will stand up - now

We will rise
Rise above

Stereotype Fools
Playing the game
Nothing unique
They all look the same
In this sea of mediocrity
I can be anything
Anything I want to be

We will rise

timeisblack
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/timeisblack.html

From a distance, the truth is so obvious,
Answers are all so clear.
Logic stays at arm's length
When engulfed in the present, here.
Desperation draws near...

If I could pull the fabric of time
And bring the future near,
The answers wouldn't be so far
The truth would be so clear.

Time is black
And nothing will escape.
Nothing will remain.
Nothing.

From a distance time is black,
Tangible and dense.
With each rotation a new day passed
And past, at last, makes sense.
There where past obstacles seem
Just pebbles on your path
Always just a step ahead
The peace I hope to catch...

onandon
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/onandon.html

We walk through war in the halls
Of dead protocols
We came so close, demands were met
That's when the rug was ripped out from under our feet
A vicious crime...cold betrayal and deceit.

Then reality hits you like a stab in the back
Like a slap in the face, a premeditated attack.

On and on...
The battle knows no victory...
On and on...
Weapons high - Reject defeat.

Decrepit smiles shine like fire
Lying through their teeth.
It's a memory you want to forget...
From one second to another the whole world went under.
The future cuts so deep tangibility bleeds.

On and on! Until the victory is dead and gone.
On and on! Kill the history, the wrong side won!

Don't let the history repeat...

Friend or foe? 
There's no way to know
Through the battlefield of life
It's kill or be killed
So many times 
It's a matter of degree
From being up on your luck
To down on your knees

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

It's times like these
When lines are drawn
Which side of the fence
Are you standing on?
There will come a day
Not so far away
When the hunter 
Becomes the prey

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

This is fucking war!

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They'd like to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

skeletondance
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/skeletondance.html

On a journey ill
My mind floats astray
Over withered fields
I cross the river

This shortness of breath
Between birth and grave
Fading in the distance
I am nothing

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death

Here I am alone
Casting my own shadows
Traversing the mundane
Desperate cry

Boundless darkness
A voiceless fear
Unheard, Unseen
It is coming near

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death
Watch the skeleton dance
Here I am - Alone...

Had I not known
That I was dead
I would have mourned
My loss of life
Loss of life...

Between birth and grave
Here I am alone
[end]
myapocalypse
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/archenemy/myapocalypse.html

Sudden implosion of silenced emotions
Buried beneath a scarred heart for too long
Delusions of hope fading away
Dying like leaves on frozen soil

My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end... Coming here

Neglecting existence, repulse and repent
An endless journey into the morbid
Whispering voices distorting all senses
Buried beneath a scattered heart for all too long

My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end... Coming here

The bitter taste of a dying dream
Shine the light on our shadows and illusions

I am forced to creep down the path
Of my sad and senseless life
Darkness surrounds me
At the end of the tunnel there is no light

A blackened void, nothingness

Lament of a mortal soul
Who am I?
Only dust in the blowing wind
Am I dying?

My name dies slowly
Echoes into eternal oblivion
Replaced by others, castly forgotten
I hate my empty existence


[1st Lead - Christopher]

Lament of a mortal soul
Who am I?
Only dust in the blowing wind
...I am dying!

Dark shadows from above
Ravens fly, obliterate the sun
&quot;It's a sign of the devil.
He will come for his servant tonight&quot;
These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies

Am I to burn
I have not sinned!
Burnt at the stake.
Innocent blood that can never be washed clean

The flames of ignorance
Grow higher and higher
Licking my flesh - burning my soul
The raven laughing in the moon

These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats.
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies again...

Here I am, back to the wall,
I picked the fight against the time,
Free at last I go my own way,
I will resist them, till the day I die,
I am who I am; my time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.

There is no second place,
No perfect world,
Your head is whole,
Freedom in your heart,
Be strong; take this chance,
Make your way; a better future comes.
I am who I am; my time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.
No gods, no masters.

The judging eyes watching me
Is all I've ever known
When I try to open up my heart
I am ridiculed and torn apart

You tell jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good
I'm not evil, just misunderstood

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name

Today I break my silence
Strip you of your dignity
Tear down your perfect world
Your perfect lies

No more jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good
I'm not evil, I'm just misunderstood.

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name
No longer invisible
You will know my name

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name
No longer invisible
You will know my name!

I dont know
I cannot see
Who we are now
How we used to be

Is it you?
Or is it we?
Look in the mirror
We are a fading memory

Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold

I will live again youll see  tomorrows not scaring me
Far away from yesterday  just take this pain away

Fatal chaos
Hurtful lies
A broken dream
Is all we left behind

Is it you?
Or is it we?
Look in the mirror
Just a fading memory

So rise my spirit rise!
Revel in this dead mans' body
Grip his soul, sip the blood
Life is death
A holy carnage

Ravenous
I will be your god
Carnivorous Jesus
I need your flesh

Ritual slaughter
Fill up the chalice
With the essence of your life
Liquid strengths
Trapped in your veins
I crave your blood
You must die!
