grievance
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/grievance.html

have a drink they're buying

bottom of, bottle of denial

big guy, big eye, watchin me

have to wonder what it sees

(sin...)

progress laced with ramifications

freedom's big plunge

pull the innocent from a crowd 

raise the sticks then bring em down

if they fail to obey

oh if they fail to obey

for every tool they lend us

a loss of independence

i pledge my grievance to the flag

cause you don't give blood then take it back again

oh we're all deserving something more

progress, taste it, invest-it-all

champagne breakfast for everyone

break the innocent when they're proud

raise the stakes then bring em down

if they fail to obey

oh if they fail to obey

pledge your grievance to the flag 

aw c'mon, don't give blood then take it back again

oh we're all deserving something more

(have a, have a, drink, drink...)

(have a, have a, drink, drink...)

i want to breathe

follow the scene

i want to taste

everyone i see

i want to run when i'm up high

i want to run into the sea

i only want life to be...

i just want to be...

i will feel alive as long as i am free...

betterman
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/betterman.html

Waitin', watchin' the clock, it's four o'clock, it's got to stop

Tell him, take no more, she practices her speech

As he opens the door, she rolls over...

Pretends to sleep as he looks her over


She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man...

She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man...

Can't find a better man

Can't find a better man

Ohh...


Talkin' to herself, there's no one else who needs to know...

She tells herself, oh...

Memories back when she was bold and strong

And waiting for the world to come along...

Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone


She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man...

She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man...

She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man...

She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man...

Can't find a better man

Can't find a better man

Yeah...


She loved him, yeah... she don't want to leave this way

She feeds him, yeah... that's why she'll be back again


Can't find a better man

Can't find a better man

Can't find a better man

Can't find a better... man...

alive
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/alive.html

Son, she said, have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin', sorry you didn't see him
but I'm glad we talked

Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey...oh

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said I'm ready...for you
I can't remember anything to this very day
'Cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare

I, I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Hey I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey I, I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh yeah...yeah yeah yeah...oh...oh

Is something wrong, she said
Well of course there is
You're still alive, she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be
Is that the question?
And if so...if so...who answers...who answers

I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, but, I'm still alive
Yeah I, ooh, I'm still alive
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better, set of days, ooh yeah
Oh, hand out, faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, oh yeah
Oh, dark grin, he can't help, when he's happy looks insane, oh yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again...

Kneelin', looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin', understands the weather of the winters on its way
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again

Whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away...
Yeah!
Woo...ah yeah...fuck it up...

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again, yeah

Oh, whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away...
Yeah!

soonforget
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/soonforget.html

sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a corvette 

thinks he'll get the girl, he'll only get the mechanic 

what's missing? he's living a day he'll soon forget 

that's one more time around, the sun is going down 

the moon is out, but he's drunk and shouting, putting people down 

he's pissing, he's living a day he'll soon forget 

counts his money every morning 

the only thing that keeps him horny

locked in a giant house, that's alarming 

the townsfolk, they all laugh 

sorry is the fool who trades his love for high-rise rent 

seems the more you make, equals the loneliness you get 

and it's fitting, he's barely living, a day he'll soon forget 

that's one more time around, there is not a sound

he's lying dead clutching benjamins, never put the money down 

he's stiffening, we're all whistling 

a man we'll soon forget

Unsealed on a porch a letter sat.

Then you said, &quot;I wanna leave it again.&quot;

Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand.

And on the sand I wanna leave it again. Yeah.

On a weekend I wanna wish it all away, yeah.

And they called and I said that &quot;I want what I said&quot; and then I call out again.

And the reason oughta' leave her calm, I know.

I said &quot;I know what I was the boxer or the bag.&quot;


Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch? Yeah, but they don't wave.

I see them round the front way. Yeah.

And I know, and I know I don't want to stay.

Make me cry...


I see... Oh I don't know why there's something else.

I wanna drum it all away...

Oh, I said, &quot;I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag.&quot;


Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch? Yeah, but they don't wave.

But I see them round the front way. Yeah.

And I know, and I know. I don't wanna stay at all.

I don't wanna stay. Yeah.

I don't wanna stay.

noway
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/noway.html

Here's a token of my openness

Of my need to not disappear

How I'm feeling, so revealing to me

I found my mind too clear

I just need someone to be there for.. me

I just want someone to be there for.. me


All the static in my attic-a

Shoots down my sciatic nerve

To the ocean of my platitudes

Longitudes, latitudes, it's so absurd

I just need someone to be there for..

I just want someone to be there for..

Someone to be there for..


'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference

I'm not trying to make a difference

I'll stop trying to make a difference

No way


Ooh, let's call in an angel


'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference

I'm not trying to make a difference

I'll stop trying to make a difference

No way

'Cause I'll stop trying to make a difference

I'm not trying to make a difference

I'll stop trying to make a difference

No way

No way, no way

Let's call in an angel

Who's calling an angel?

daughter
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pearljam/daughter.html

You guys ready...
Alone... listless... breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl... violins... center of her own attention
Mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it
Tries to make her proud
The shades go down, it's in her head
Painted room... can't deny there's something wrong...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will... rise above...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be
The picture kept will remind me
Don't call me...
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go, go, go...
