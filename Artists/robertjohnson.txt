I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees
I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above &quot;Have mercy, save poor Bob, if you please&quot;

Mmm, standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride
Standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by

Mmm, the sun goin' down, boy, dark gon' catch me here
Ooo, oooeee, boy, dark gon' catch me here
I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that love and feel my care

You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
You can run, tell my friend-boy Willie Brown
Lord, that I'm standin' at the crossroad, babe, I believe I'm sinkin' down

kindheartedwomanblues

I got a kind hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
I got a kind hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women
Man, they will not let me be
I love my baby
My baby don't love me
I love my baby, oooh
My baby don't love me
But I really love that woman
Can't stand to leave her be

A-ain't but the one thing
Makes  Mister Johnson drink
I's worried 'bout how you treat me, baby
I begin to think
Oh babe, my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart
When you call Mister So-and-So's name

She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You well's to kill me
As to have it on your mind

Beatrice, she got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word
Beatrice, she got a phonograph, but it won't say a lonesome word
What evil have I done, what evil has the poor girl heard

Beatrice, I love my phonograph, but you have broke my windin' chain
Beatrice, I love my phonograph, ooh, honey, you have broke my windin' chain
And you've taken my lovin', and give it to your other man

Now, we played it on the sofa, now, we played it 'side the wall
My needles have got rusty, baby, they will not play at all
We played it on the sofa, and we played it 'side the wall
But my needles have got rusty, and it will not play at all

Beatrice, I go crazy, baby, I will lose my mind
And I go cra'eeh, honey, I will lose my mind
Why'n't1 you bring your clothes back home, and try me one more time

She got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word
She got a phonograph, ooh, won't say a lonesome word
What evil have I done, or what evil have the poor girl heard

And I feel so lonesome, you hear me when I moan
When I feel so lonesome, you hear me when I moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane1, for you since I been gone.

I'd said I flash your lights, mama, you horn won't even blow
(Somebody's been runnin' my batteries down on this machine)
I even flash my lights, mama, this horn won't even blow
Got a short in this connection, hoo well, babe, it's way down below

I'm gion' heist your hood, mama, I'm bound to check your oil
I'm goin' heist your hood, mama, mmm, I'm bound to check your oil
I got a woman that I'm lovin', way down in Arkansas

Now, you know the coils ain't even buzzin', little generator won't get the spark
Motor's in a bad condition, you gotta have these batteries charged
But I'm cryin', pleease, pleease don't do me wrong.
Who been drivin' my Terraplane1 now for, you since I been gone.

Mr. highway man, please don't block the road
Puh hee hee, please don't block the road
'Cause she's reachin' a cold one hundred and I'm booked and I got to go

Yoo... you hear me weep and moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane1 now for, you since I been gone

I'm gon' get down in this connection, keep on tanglin' with your wires
I'm gon' get down in this connection, oh well, keep on tanglin' with these wires
And when I mash down on your little starter, then your spark plug will give me fire

If your man get personal, want you to have your fun
If your man get personal, want you to have your fun
Best come on back to Friars Point, mama, and barrelhouse all night long

I got women's in Vicksburg, clean on into Tennessee
I got women's in Vicksburg, clean on into Tennessee
But my Friars Point1 rider, now, hops all over me

I ain't gon' to state no color but her, front teeth crowned with gold
I ain't gon' to state no color but her, front teeth is crowned with gold
She got a mortgage on my body, now, and a lien on my soul

Lord, I'm goin' to Rosedale, gon' take my rider by my side
Lord, I'm goin' to Rosedale, gon' take my rider by my side
We can still barrelhouse baby, on the riverside

Now you can squeeze my lemon 'til the juice run down my...
('Til the juice rune down my leg, baby, you know what I'm talkin' about)
You can squeeze my lemon 'til the juice run down my leg
(That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, now)
But I'm goin' back to Friars Point, if I be rockin'to my head

I woke up this mornin' and all my shrimps was dead and gone
I woke up this mornin', ooh, and all my shrimp was dead and gone
I was thinkin' about you, baby, why you hear me weep and moan

I got dead shrimps here, someone is fishin' in my pond
I got dead shrimps here, ooh, someone fishin' in my pond
I've served my best bait, baby, and I can't do that no harm1

Everything I do, babe, you got your mouth stuck out
Hole where I used to fish, you got me posted out
Everything I do, you got your mouth stuck out,
At the hole where I used to fish, baby, you've got me posted out

I got dead shrimps here, 'n' someone fishin' in my pond
I got dead shrimps here, someone fishin' in my pond
Catchin' my goggle-eye perches, and they barbequin' the bone

Now you taken my shrimps, baby, you know you turned me down
I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound
You taken my shrimps, oh, know you turned me down
Babe, I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound

I got stones in my passway
And my road seem dark as night
I got stones in my passway
And my road seem dark as night
I have pains in my hearts
They have taken my appetite

I have a bird to whistle
And I have a bird to sing
Have a bird to whistle
And I have a bird to sing
I got a woman that I'm lovin'
Boy but she don't mean a thing

My enemies have betrayed me
Have overtaken poor Bob at last
My enemies have betrayed me
Have overtaken poor Bob at last
And there's one thing certainly
They have stones all in my pass

Now you tryin' to take my life
And all my lovin' too
You laid a passway for me
Now what are you trying to do
I'm cryin' please
Please let us be friends
And when you hear me howlin' in my passway, rider
Please open your door and let me in

I got three legs to truck home
Boys, please don't block my road
I got three legs to truck home
Boys, please don't block my road
I've been feelin' ashamed 'bout my rider
Babe, I'm booked and I got to go

Mmm, when you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right

I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why
I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why
Everytime I thinks about it, I just wring my hands and cry

Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me
Or would she sympathize with me
She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be

I love my baby, but I can't make that ag'ee
I love that woman, but what can we can't agree
I really love that woman, nnn, wonder why we can't agree

It's your opinion, friend-girl, I may be right or wrong
It's yo'y opinion friend-girl, I may be right or wrong
But when you watch your close friend, baby
Then your enemies can't do you no harm

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side
Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right

drunkenheartedman
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robertjohnson/drunkenheartedman.html

I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery
I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery
And if I could change my way of livin', it would mean so much to me

I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's home
I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's home
And I can't see the reason why that, I can't leave these no-good women's alone

My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she could
My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she could
Every man likes that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no good

Now, I'm the drunken hearted man and sin was the cause of it all
(Oh, play 'em now)
I'm a drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all
And the day that you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that you bound to fall

And I followed her to the station, with my suitcase in my hand
And I followed her to the station, with my suitcase in my hand
Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, when all your love's in vain
All my love's in vain

When the train rolled up to the station, I looked her in the eye
When the train rolled up to the station, and I looked her in the eye
Well, I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome, and I could not help but cry
All my love's in vain

When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind
When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind
Well, the blue light was my blues, and the red light was my mind
All my love's in vain

Ou hou ou ou ou, hoo, Willie Mae
Oh oh oh oh oh hey, hoo, Willie Mae
Ou ou ou ou ou ou hee vee oh woe
All my love's in vain
