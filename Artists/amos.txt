Hey I am not in your way

Hey no need to push me again

I know it's your day in the sun

Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone


&quot;Relax love&quot; he said before he left

&quot;Take those hands away from your eyes

From where I stand you're in my sky&quot;


You must go must flee

For they will hunt you down

You and your unborn seed

In all of Gaul is there safety?


Les Saint Marie de la Mer

You will dance the ring

Marys of the Sea

The lost bride weeps

Les Saint Marie de la Mer

We will dance your ring


Hey there's a new Jerusalem

Hey you built on rock that's on sand

For now you have hijacked the son

Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone


I hear a voice and it says

&quot;The red of the red rose is its own

And something no man can divide&quot;

So St. Jermaine hear the prayer of this supplicant

For two scarlet women, Black Madonna

Hey I am not in your way

Hey no need to push me again

I know it's your day in the sun

I know it's your day in the sun

Hey I am not in your way

Hey no need to push me again

I know it's your day in the sun

Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us a yo heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time
This is not really happening
You bet your life it is 
[3x]

Peal out the watchword
Just peal out the watchword

She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeties are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They must've paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love
This is not really happening
You bet your life it is 
[3x]

Peal our the watchword
Just peal out the watchword

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Oh, yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, where'd you put the keys, girl

And the man with the golden gun thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much yeah
(Don't close this door I know it's so easy)
And the man with the golden gun thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much yeah
(To close this door I know it's so easy)

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?

That guy swears he will walk

And carries a chip as big as new york

That guy

At night makes me scream

And smashes the best possibilities

That guy

Just brings his war home she cries

Why can't daddy leave his war outside?

That guy

When he wants can love

Like no other love

Until the darkness comes

Do we make up to break up?

Do we break up then wake up?

To cuts instead of kisses

To cuts instead

Instead

Instead

That guy swears he will walk

And carries a chip as big as new york

That guy

Cannot seem to see

There are no other guys

But the one he used to be

Do we make up to break up?

Do we break up then wake up?

To cuts instead of kisses

To cuts instead

Instead

Instead

Will we make up?

Will we break up?

Will I wake up with with

That guy

That guy

That guy

if you're a thought 

you will want me 

to think you 

and i did invite 

a guest up until 

you announced 

you had moved in 

&quot;what do you plan to do with all your freedom?&quot; 

the new sheriff said, 

quite proud of his badge 

&quot;you must admit the land is now in good hands&quot; 

yes, time will tell 

that you just life your lamp


i will follow her on her path 

scarlet's walk through the voilets 

just tell your gods for me 

all debts are off this year 

they're free to leave 

yes they're free to leave 

leaving terra leaving terra


there was a time 

when i thought 

that her destiny 

should've been mine 

big brave nation 

but instead her medicine 

now forgotten 

&quot;what do you plan to do with all your stories&quot; 

the new sheriff said, 

quite proud of his badge 

we'll weave them through 

every rocket's red glare 

and huddled masses 

you just lift your lamp 

i will follow. 

if you're a thought 

you will want me 

to think you 

and i did and did.

I've been on the other side

Got my lips smacked now they're dry

Then you call me call me in

You think I am your possession

You're

Messing with a southern girl

But my recipe is on

With your

Stale bread yeah it's hot

But baby I don't need your cash


So BABY maybe I let your


Big Wheel turn my

Fantasy

Don't you throw that shade on me

I've been drinkin' down your pain

Gonna turn that whiskey into rain and

Wash it away

Wash it away

Wash it away boy

Let's go


I've been on my knees

But you're so hard

Hard to please

Did you take me take me in

So you are a superstar

Get off the cross we need the wood


Somehow you will rise

But without a tool

I know honey you're a pro

But BABY I don't need your cash


Mama got it all in hand now

Big Wheel turn my

Fantasy

Don't you throw that shade on me

I've been drinkin' down your pain

Gonna turn that whiskey into rain and


Wash it away

Wash it away

Wash it away boy


Gimme 8

Gimme 7

Gimme 6

Gimme 5 Gimme 4 Gimme 3


I. I. I am a M-I-L-F don' you forget

M-I-L-F don' you forget

M-I-L-F don' you forget


Baby I don't need your cash

So BABY maybe I let your 

Big Wheel turn my

Fantasy

Don't you throw that shade on me

I've been drinkin' down your pain

Gonna turn that whiskey love into rain

Gonna turn your whiskey boy into rain and

Wash it away

Wash you away boy

Wash you down

Big Wheel

Not tonight Josephine


In an army's strength

Therein lies the denouemnet

From here you've haunting me

By the seine so beautiful

Only not ot be of use

Impossible


So strange

Victory - 1,200 spires

Th only sound

Moscow turning

Empth like the Tuileries

Like a dream

Vienna seems 

Only not to be of use

Impossible


In the last extrmity

To advance or not to advance

I hear you laughing


Even still you're calling me

&quot;Not tonight, not tonight, not tonight&quot;

Josephine

Watch the boats go by
And someone else's life
Those smiling faces
We've worn them before
Watch the boats go by
No that is not our life
Not today
Not today
Some things work out that way

I'm not gonna be angry
Lately seems like everything
Is falling down
All around
Us
We gotta turn that frown
We gotta turn that frown
Upside Down

Those smiling faces
We've worn them before
Watch the boats go by
No that is not our life
Not today
Not today
Some things work out that way

I'm not gonna be angry
Lately seems like everything
Is falling down
All around
Us

We gotta turn that frown
We gotta turn that frown
Upside Down
Upside Down

Police yourself

Police yourself

Police me

Police yourself

Police yourself

Police me


We've got your own remote viewing

Every cell has been taught to think

Perhaps the answer to the question

Lies in the question

Perhaps you should read my thoughts

Line them up like soldiers


Police yourself

Police youself

Police me


Loaded, full of winter you are

Storming Blackberry girl

Will you strike before he's

Loaded, full of winter you are storming

Blackberry girl will you strike

Before he's loaded

Full of winter you are


Police yourself

Police yourself

Police me


Can they monitor how you think?

They've got their own remote viewing

To get off he cries &quot;slutty goth&quot;

But I'm a brightly colored person


Loaded, full of winter you are

Storming Blackberry girl

Will you strike before he's

Loaded, full of winter you are storming

Blackberry girl will you strike

Before he's loaded


Full of winter you are

Perhaps the answer to the question

Lies in the question

Perhaps you should read my thoughts

Line them up like soldiers


Police yourself

Police yourself

Police me

I know what you want the magpies have come
If you know me so well then tell me which hand I use
Make them go
Make it go

Saw her there in a restaurant 
Poppy don't go
I know your mother is a good one
But Poppy don't go
I'll take you home

Show me the things I've been missing
Show me the ways I forgot to be speaking
Show me the ways to get back to the Garden
Show me the ways to get around the get around
Show me the ways to button up buttons 
That have forgotten they're buttons
Well we can't have that forgetting that

Girls girls what have we done to ourselves 
Driving on the vine over clothes lines
But Officer I saw the sign
Thought I'd been through this in 1919
Counting the tears of ten thousand men
And gathered them all but my feet are slipping
There's something we left on the windowsill
There's something we left yes

We'll see how brave you are
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia
And all your dollies have friends

Thought she deserved no less than she'd give
Well happy birthday her blood's on my hands
It's kind of a shame 'cause I did like that dress
It's funny the things that you find in the rain
The things that you find in the mall and in the date mines
In the knot still in her hair
On the bus I'm on my way down
On my way down 
All the girls seem to be there

We'll see how brave you are
Oh yes, we'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see
We'll see how brave you are
Oh yes, we'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia

Come along now little darlin'
Come along now with me 
Come along now little darlin'
We'll see how brave you are

weatherman

He is not a weatherman
But his bride lies with the land
And she will whisper to him
I'll be dressing up in snow
Cloaked in echo it's almost
As if only Nature knows
How to bring his wife to life
And breathe her into form

&quot;One more look from her eyes
One more look can you paint her back to life&quot;

He knows every moor and mound
Every curve of every hill
A shoulder of the mountain
Where they watched a thousand dawns

&quot;One more look from her eyes
One more look can you paint her back to life&quot;

Rising she stirs
First it blurs
A breeze that lifts
Lilac blossoms from the earth
Blending its shape
To a skirt
With limbs that bend
He's drawn toward her pirouette turn
Autumn's peach black
Winter's velvet coat
Pink Tourmaline,
Palette of Spring
In Summer she's wrapped in Viennese green

He is not a weatherman
But his bride lies with the land
And she will whisper to him
I'll be dressing up in snow
Cloaked in echo it's almost
As if only Nature knows
How to paint his wife to life
With every season's tone

&quot;One more look from her eyes
One more look can you paint her back to life&quot;

Some say that I will and some say I won't

Victory is an elusive whore

She is as easily mine

As she is yours


Slip and slide my way through this charade

I know all the players and I must say

Do this long enough

You get a taste for it


I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine

Leave them troubled boys all behind

What you stole, I would have given freely

Code Red you're staring Code Red staring at me


Well sometimes he do and sometimes he don't

Sometimes I love myself best alone

Do this long enough

You get a taste for it


A six pack of Coke and a bottle of Jack

&quot;whatever you do&quot; he said &quot;look after that,&quot; yeah well

Being trusted and lusted

It could be worse than that


I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine

Leave them troubled boys all behind

What you stole, I would have given freely

Code Red staring Code Red staring


Come on baby I can drink you down

Then I have my job to do and do well

Since you won't give guarantees


I'll be cashing out

I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine

Leave them troubled boys all behind

Said I'll do this last one and I'll grow me some wine

Leave them troubled boys all behind


What you stole, I would have given freely

Code Red staring Code Red staring
