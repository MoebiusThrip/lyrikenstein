You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever
But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun

And the colours of the sea bind your eyes with trembling mermaids
And you touch the distant beaches with tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured by the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you to kiss their white laced lips

And you see a girl's brown body dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow where the sky loves the sea
And when your fingers find her, she drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples in the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite and she rides a crimson shell
And you know you cannot leave her for you touched the distant sands
With tales of brave Ulysses, how his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing

The tiny purple fishes run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you to the hard land of the winter

It's gettin' near dawn,
When lights close their tired eyes.
I'll soon be with you my love,
To give you my dawn surprise.
I'll be with you darling soon,
I'll be with you when the stars start falling.

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love.

I'm with you my love,
The light's shinin' through on you.
Yes, I'm with you my love,
It's the morning and just we two.
I'll stay with you darling now,
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up.

I've been waiting so long
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love.

I'm with you my love,
The light's shinin' through on you.
Yes, I'm with you my love,
It's the morning and just we two.
I'll stay with you darling now,
I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up.

I've been waiting so long 
[x3]
To be where I'm going
In the sunshine of your love.

Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now what you gonna do?
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

Strange brew, strange brew, strange brew, strange brew
Strange brew - killin' what's inside of you

Hey, hey, hey, hey , hey , hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey , hey , hey, hey

We were rollin' and tumblin'
Right the whole night long

We were rollin' and tumblin'
Right the whole night long

When I woke up this mornin' baby
All I had was gone

Well I rolled my baby
She's goin' to jump and shout

Well I rolled my baby
She's goin' to jump and shout

When that train rolls up boys
I'm gonna come walkin' on home

Hey, hey, hey, hey , hey , hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey , hey , hey, hey

Engine driver blows that whistle
Fireman rings that bell

Engine driver blows that whistle
Fireman rings that bell

Well I didn't have time boys
To bid my baby farewell


[Live Cream:]

Hey, hey, hey, hey , hey , hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey , hey , hey, hey, hey
yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

We were rollin' and tumblin'
Right the whole night long

We were rollin' and tumblin'
Right the whole night long

When I woke up this mornin' babe
All I had was gone

Well I rolled my baby
Got to jump and shout

Said I rolled my baby
Got to jump and shout

When that train rolls up boys
Goin' walkin' on home

Hey, hey, hey, hey , hey , hey, hey, hey
yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
Hey, hey, hey, yeh , hey , hey, yeh, yey

Well engine driver blows that whistle
Fireman rings that bell

Say engine driver blows that whistle
Fireman rings that bell

Well I didn't have time boys
To bid my baby farewell

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.
Right away, far away, take that thing right outa here.

Don't let them take me to where streams are red.
I want to stay here and sleep in my own bed.
Need all your loving, long blonde hair,
Don't let them take me 'cos I easily scare.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.
Right away, far away, take that thing right outa here.

I got this great need, the need to stay alive.
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive.
So come on baby, don't go 'way,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.

I got this need, the need to stay alive.
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive.
So come on baby, don't go away,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.
Right away, far away, take that thing right outa here.

I got this thing, I've got to keep it sharp.
Don't go to places where it won't shine in the dark.
So come on baby, don't go away,
Just let them save me for a rainy day.
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outa here.

Thinkin' 'bout the times you drove in my car.
Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far.
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table.

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark.
I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park.
Then I told you 'bout our kid: now he's married to Mabel.

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down.
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down.
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.

Ah Ah Ah, yeh yeh yeh
Ah Ah Ah, yeh yeh yeh

Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you.
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.

Wanna go out, baby, too late at night.
Lawdy mama, no need to worry.
Wanna go out, baby, too late at night.
I got a real funny feelin'
You're gonna treat your daddy right.

Long-legged woman, come and hold my hand.
Lawdy mama, no need to worry.
Long-legged woman, come and hold my hand.
I got a real funny feelin'
You wanna love some other man.

Leavin' in the mornin', you're cryin' won't make me stay
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Leavin' in the mornin' baby, you're cryin' won't make me stay
The more you cry baby, further gonna drive your daddy away

Leavin' in the mornin', you're cryin' won't make me stay
Lawdy mama, no need to worry
Leavin' in the mornin' baby, you're cryin' won't make me stay
The more you cry baby, further gonna drive your daddy away

I'm a sleepy time baby, a sleepy time boy.
Work only maybe, life is a joy.

We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time all the time.

Asleep in the daytime, asleep at night.
Life is all playtime; working ain't right.

We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time all the time.

I have my Sunday, that ain't no lie.
But on Monday morning comes my favorite try.

We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
We'll have a sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time.
Sleepy time time all the time.

dreaming
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cream/dreaming.html

Dreaming about my love.
You bring me joy and hours of happiness,
More or less.
I dream my life away.

Waiting for you to come.
Changing my life for you to emptyness,
Meaningless.
Minutes just drift by.

I don't care if I get nowhere.
I can just dream and you'll be there.
What else is there to do?

Dreaming about my life.
Where are you now, and when will you
Come to me?
I dream my life away.

I don't care if I get nowhere.
I can just dream and you'll be there.
What else is there to do?

Dreaming about my love;
You bring me joy and hours of happiness,
More or less.
I dream my life away.

Dreaming, dreaming.

Driving in my car, smoking my cigar,
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

Singing in my yacht, what a lot I got,
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

I've been in and I'm out, I've been up and down,
I don't want to go until I've been all around.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

What's it all about, anyone in doubt,
I don't want to go until I've found it all out.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
