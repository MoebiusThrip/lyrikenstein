stairwaytoheaven
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ledzeppelin/stairwaytoheaven.html

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

therover
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ledzeppelin/therover.html

I've been to London, seen seven wonders. I know to trip is just to fall 

I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it. I always knew what it was for. 


There can be no denyin' that the wind 'll shake 'em down 

And the flat world's flyin'. There's a new plague on the land 


If we could just join hands 
[X3]


Traversed the planet when heaven sent me. I saw the kings who rule them all 

Still by the firelight and purple moonlight. I hear the rested rivers call 

And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold 

My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe 


If we could just join hands 
[X3]


You got me rockin' when I ought to be a-rollin' 

Darlin', tell me, darlin', which way to go 

You keep me rockin', baby, then you keep me stolen 

Won't you tell me, darlin', which way to go... that's right 


Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry and I would dearly like to know 

I've all this wonder of earthly plunder will it leave us anything to show 


And our time is flyin' see the candle burnin' low 

Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old 


If we could just join hands.

[Chorus]

You've been coolin', baby, I've been droolin',
All the good times I've been misusin',
Way, way down inside, I'm gonna give you my love,
I'm gonna give you every inch of my love,
Gonna give you my love.


[Chorus]

Way down inside... woman... You need... love.

Shake for me, girl. I wanna be your backdoor man.
Keep it coolin', baby.

Then as it was, then again it will be 

An' though the course may change sometimes 

Rivers always reach the sea 

Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays 

On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey 

Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow 

But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go 


Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me 

In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be 


Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad 

Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had 

Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good 

'Cause it was just the first time, And you knew you would 


Through the eyes an' I sparkle, Senses growing keen 

Taste your love along the way, See your feathers preen 

Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow 

We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul 


Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me 

Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be 

Oh darlin', oh darlin' 


I'm never gonna leave you. I never gonna leave 

Holdin' on, ten years gone 

Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone

nightflight
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ledzeppelin/nightflight.html

I received a message from my brother across the water 

He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight 

So I said goodbye to all my friends 

And packed my hopes inside a matchbox 

'Cause I know it's time to fly 


Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night 

The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright 


I just jumped a train that never stops, 

So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride 

Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand 

Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require 


Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night 

The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright 


Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leavin' 

Nothin' here to make me stay 

Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm goin' 

They're knockin' down them doors 

They're tryin' to take me away 


Please Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell. And ring loud and clear 

Please Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell 

Tell the people they got to fly away from here 


I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby 

Southern lady, had a very, very special smile 

We are in the middle of a change in destination 

When the train stops, all together we will smile 

Oh, meet me in the morning. 

Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night 

Everybody know the mornin' time is comin' 

Don't it make you wanna feel alright. Ah, ah, yeah 

Make me feel alright. Fly now, baby 

Get to fly, yeah. Fly now, baby

If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay

Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well

Don't it make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home
You don't know which way to go?
If you're goin' down South
They got no work to do,
If you don't know about Chicago

Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move

All last night sat on the levee and moaned
All last night sat on the levee and moaned
Thinkin' about my baby and my happy home

Going, going to Chicago...
Going to Chicago...
Sorry but I can't take you...
Going down... going down now... going down....

When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills. 

Livin', lovin', she's just a woman.

Tellin' tall tales of how it used to be. 

Livin', lovin', she's just a woman. 

With the butler and the maid and the servants three.

Nobody hears a single word you say.

Ah, ah.
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow.
Hammer of the gods, will drive our ships to new land.
To fight the hordes, and sing and cry.
Valhalla I am coming.

Always sweep with, with threshing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

Ah, ah.
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow.
How soft your fields so green. Can whisper tales of gore.
Of how we calmed the tides of war. We are your over Lords.

Always sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore.

So now you'd better stop, and rebuild all your ruins.
For peace and trust can win the day, despite of all your losing.

Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh
Ooh. Ah.

Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand,
Take him to some shady bower, save me from the wrath of this man,
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this mad man.

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile,
Tell me that I'm free to ride,
Ride for many a mile, mile, mile.

You said I was the only, With my lemon in your hand 

Exhibition is your habit, Emotion second hand. 

Had to pull away to save me, Maybe next time around 

And she said, 'don't you want it? 

Don't you want cocaine-cocaine-cocaine 

Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah.


Heard a cry for mercy, In the city of the damned 

Oh oh babe, damned. Down in the pits you go no lower

The next stop's underground.  Oh, hello underground.

Wine and roses ain't quite over, fate deals a losing hand

And I said: didn't mean to... did not mean to fail 

You didn't plan it, you over-ran it 


You wanna do it, you wanna 

You wanna do it when you wanna 

You wanna do it, do it when you wanna 


When you blow it, babe, You got to blow it right 

Oh baby, if you fake it, mama, Baby, fake with all your might 

When you fake it, mama, Please fake it right  (for yourself babe)


When you fake it baby,

You're fakin' it for your life, for your life, for your life, for your life 

Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, Do it when you wanna 

Do it, do it, do it, Do it when you wanna 


Oh, I can have you, baby, But I don't know what to do, yeah 

Sometime, baby, nothin' I could do 

On the balance of a crystal, Payin' through the nose 

And when they couldn't resist you, I thought you'd go with the flow.


And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please. 

Fold up your show 

Hadn't planned to, Could not stand to fry in it

Hadn't planned it, I over-ran it, (fryin) 

For your life, For your life.

Oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream 

I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been 

To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen 

They talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed 


Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my ear 

But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear 

Oh, oh. 


Oh, I been flying... mama, there ain't no denyin' 

I've been flying, ain't no denyin', no denyin' 


All I see turns to brown, as the sun burns the ground 

And my eyes fill with sand, as I scan this wasted land 

Trying to find, trying to find where I've been. 


Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream 

Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream 

My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again 

Sure as the dust that floats high in June, when movin' through Kashmir. 


Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years 

With no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear 

Ohh. 


When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah 

When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah 


Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down... 

Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, well I'm down, so down 

Ooh, my baby, oooh, my baby, let me take you there 


Let me take you there. Let me take you there

Oh, Baby, it's cryin' time, Oh, Baby, I got to fly. 

Got to try to find a way, Got to try to get away, 

'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, Babe. 


Oh, Baby, the river's red, Oh, Baby, in my head. 

There's a funny feelin' goin' on, I don't think I can hold out long. 


[Chorus]

And when the owls cry in the night, Oh, Baby, Baby, when the pines begin to cry, 

Baby, Baby, Baby, how do you feel? If the river runs dry, Baby, 

How do you feel? 


Craze, Baby, the rainbow's end, Baby, it's just a den 

For those who hide, Who hide their love to depths of life 

And ruin dreams that we all knew so, Babe. 


[Chorus]

Bright light almost blinding, black night still there shining,
I can't stop, keep on climbing, looking for what I knew.

Had a friend, she once told me, &quot;You got love, you ain't lonely, &quot;
Now she's gone and left me only looking for what I knew.

Mmm, I'm telling you now, The greatest thing you ever can do now,
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now, It's very easy just...

Met a man on the roadside crying, without a friend, there's no denying,
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding looking for what you knew.

So anytime somebody needs you, don't let them down, although it grieves you,
Some day you'll need someone like they do, looking for what you knew.

Mmm, I'm telling you now, The greatest thing you ever can do now,
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now, It's very easy just...

I'm telling you now, the greatest thing you ever can do now,
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now,

It's very easy...

Hey, hey mama, said the way you move,
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.

Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out.

Spent my money, took my car,
Started tellin' her friends she gonna be a star.

A big legged woman ain't got no soul.

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, ah, ah, ah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, ah, ah, yeah.

Steady-loaded woman gonna come my way.

Will tell me no lies, make me a happy man.

It was an April morning when they told us we should go 

As I turn to you, you smiled at me 

How could we say no? 


With all the fun to have, to live the dreams we always had 

Oh, the songs to sing, when we at last return again 


Sending off a glancing kiss, to those who claim they know 

Below the streets that steam and hiss, 

The devil's in his hole 


Oh to sail away, To sandy lands and other days 

Oh to touch the dream, Hides inside and never seen. 


Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown 

The shackles of commitment fell, In pieces on the ground 


Oh to ride the wind, To tread the air above the din 

Oh to laugh aloud, Dancing as we fought the crowd 


To seek the man whose pointing hand, The giant step unfolds 

With guidance from the curving path, That churns up into stone 


If one bell should ring, in celebration for a king 

So fast the heart should beat, As proud the head with heavy feet. 


Days went by when you and I, bathed in eternal summers glow 

As far away and distant, Our mutual child did grow 


Oh the sweet refrain, Soothes the soul and calms the pain 

Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again 


Wandering &amp; wandering, What place to rest the search 

The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth 


The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth 

From the earth... 


I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way 
[X2]


Oh the mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth.

Don't wantcha ringin my bell

Tired of ya doing the things that you do

Follow the line, you better follow queue 


I say, ooooh, it's my love

[X2]


I could sail a river run dead, but I know it's dead

I could I wish for a million, yeah. But I know it's dead

I could cry within the darkness, I sail away 

I save a lifetime forever

But you know, you know, you know what I say 


And I say Ooh, it's my love 

Oooh, it's my own true love

Oh, look over there 
Here she comes 
Here comes that girl again 
One that I know since I don't know when 
But she don't notice me, when I pass 
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class 
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man, she's something else. 

Hey, look over there 
Across the street 
There's a car just right for me 
Took on a quality of luxery 
But right now I can't afford the gas 
I guess the cars right out of my class 
But that can't stop me from thinkin' to myself 
That cars fine lookin' man, it something else. 

Hey, look-a here 
Just wait and see 
I'm gonna work hard and save my dough 
Gonna buy the car 
Get me that girl and go ridin' around 
We'll go to the shop a right block down 
I'll keep on right on dreamin' and thinkin' to myself 
If it all comes true man, wow, that's something else. 

Look a-here 
What's all this 
Never thought I'd do this before 
But here I am a-knockin' on a door 
My cars out front 
And it's all mine 
Justa 41 ford not a 59 
I've got that girl and I'm a thinkin' to myself 
She's sure fine lookin' man, wow, she's something else.

And if you feel that you can't go on. And your will's sinkin' low

Just believe and you can't go wrong.

In the light you will find the road. You will find the road


Oh, did you ever believe that I could leave you, standing out in the cold

I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through to the very depths of my soul.

Baby, I just want to show you what a clear view it is from every bend in the road.

Now listen to me

Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was and really would be for you, too, honey

As you would for me, oh, I would share your load.

Let me share your load. Ooh, let me share, share your load


And if you feel that you can't go on

In the light you will find the road


Though the winds of change may blow around you, but that will always be so

When love is pain it can devour you, if you are never alone

I would share your load. I would share your load

Baby, let me, oh, let me


In the light

Everybody needs the light.

In the light, in the light, in the light


Light, light, light, in the light

Light, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah

Light, light, light, in the light

Hey lady--you got the love I need 

Maybe more than enough. 

Oh Darling... walk a while with me 

You've got so much... 


Many have I loved - Many times been bitten 

Many times I've gazed along the open road. 


Many times I've lied - Many times I've listened 

Many times I've wondered how much there is to know. 


Many dreams come true and some have silver linings 

I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold. 


Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing 

Many many men can't see the open road. 


Many is a word that only leaves you guessing 

Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh! 

You really ought to know...

Walkin' in the park just the other day, Baby, 

What do you, what do you think I saw? 

Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said, 

&quot;Hey, Boy, do you wanna score?&quot; 

And you know how it is; 

I really don't know what time it was, woh, oh, 

So I asked them if I could stay awhile. 


I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really, 

Really out of my mind. 

Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said, 

&quot;Please, hey, would we care to all get in line, 

Get in line.&quot; 

Well you know, They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, 

Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh. 


Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see, 

And Baby, Baby, Baby, do you like it? 

There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin' 

Ah, not trying to fight it. 

You really don't care if they're coming, oh, oh, 

I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh. 


If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better, 

You better open your eyes. 

Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't 

Which, which way the pressure lies, 

So I've decided what I'm gonna do now. 

So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains 

Where the spirits go now, 

Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh. 

I really don't know.

As I walk down the highway all I do is sing this song, 

And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along. 

There is no doubt about the words are clear, 

The voice is strong, is oh so strong. 


I'm just a simple guy, I live from day to day. 

A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away, 

There's nothing more that I can say but on a day like today 

I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you. 


[Chorus]

All I need from you is all your love, 

All you got to give to me is all your love, 

All I need from you is all your love, 

All you got to give to me is all your love. 

Oooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, oh yeah. 


I'm so glad I'm living and gonna tell the world I am, 

I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man, 

One thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the loving 

Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can. 


Standing in the noonday sun trying to flag a ride, 

People go and people come, see my rider right by my side, 

It's a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a race 

And the best thing I can do is run. 


[Chorus]
