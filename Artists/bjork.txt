humanbehaviour
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/humanbehaviour.html

If you ever get close to a human
And human behavior
Be ready, be ready to get confused
And me and my hereafter
There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
To human behavior
But yet so, yet so irresistible
And me and my fear can
And there's no map uncertain

They're terribly, terribly, terribly moody of human behavior
Then all of a sudden, turn happy and they and my here after
But, oh, to get involved in the exchange of human emotions
Is ever so ever so satisfying and they and my here, oh
And there's no map uncertain

Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior

And there's no map
And a compass wouldn't help at all
Yeah, uncertain

Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior, human behavior
Human behavior

There's definitely, definitely, definitely no logic
To human, to human, to human, to human

atomdance
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/atomdance.html

We are each others hemispheres

I am finetuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance

Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide 
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation 

Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each others hemispheres

We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love 
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home 
Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each others hemispheres

No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere
The atoms are dancing

No one is a lover alone 
Most hearts fear their own home

sueme
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/sueme.html

My tear duct clogged
My left eye broken
Medicate with warm compress
Extract hardened tears

Sue me, sue me, sue me
All you want
I won't denounce her origin
Sue me, sue me, sue me
All you want
I won't denounce our origin

I've ducked and dived
Like the mother in Solomon's tale
To spare our girl
I won't let her get cut in half ever
But it's time to teach her some dignity

Sue me, sue me, sue me
All you want
I won't denounce our origin
Sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me
All you want
I won't denounce our origin
(No I won't)

He took it from his father
Who took it from his father
Who took it from his father
Let's break this curse
So it won't fall on our daughter
And her daughter
And her daughter
Won't let this sink into her DNA

Sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me
All you want
I won't let you denounce our origin
Sue me, sue me, sue me, sue me
I won't denounce our origin
No I won't

Can't take her suffer
So unfair
The sins of the fathers
They just fucked it all up
We had the best family
We had it all
We had it all in our hands
He just pulled us through the wringer
Narcissistic

themodernthings

all the modern things

like cars and such

have always existed


they've just been waiting in a mountain

for the right moment


listening to the irritating noises

of dinosaurs and people

dabbling outside


all the modern things

have always existed

they've just been waiting


to come out

and multiply

and take over


it's their turn now...

hiddenplace
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/hiddenplace.html

Through the warmthest

Cord of care

Your love was sent to me


I'm not sure

What to do with it

Or where to put it


I'm so close to tears

And so close to

Simply calling you up

I'm simply suggesting


We go to the hidden place

That we go to the hidden place

We go to the hidden place

We go to a hidden place


Now I have

Been slightly shy

And I can smell a pinch of hope

To almost have allowed once fingers

To stroke

The fingers I was given to touch with

But careful, careful

There lies my passion, hidden

There lies my love

I'll hide it under a blanket

Lull it to sleep


I'll keep it in a hidden place

I'll keep it in a hidden place

Keep it in a hidden place

Keep it in a hidden place


He's the beautifullest

Fragilest

Still strong

Dark and divine

And the littleness of his movements

Hides himself

He invents a charm that makes him invisible

Hides in the air

Can I hide there too?

Hide in the air of him

Seek solace

Sanctuary


In the hidden place

In a hidden place

In a hidden place

We'll stay in a hidden place

Ooohh in a hidden place

We'll live in a hidden place

We'll be in a hidden place

In a hidden place

futureforever
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/futureforever.html

Imagine a future and be in it
Feel this incredible nurture soak it in
Your past is on loop, turn it off
See this possible future and be in it

Hold fort for love forever
We're just momentary vessels
We're just carrying

Trust your head around
Guide your stare elsewhere
Your love is already waiting
Your already in it

Hold fort for love forever

Watch me form new nests
Weave a matriarchal dome
Build a musical scaffolding
Between sleep and awake
Day and night
(Between night and day)

You say I mirror peoples missions at them
Now you mirror at me who I used to be
What I gave to the world
You're giving back at me
Hold fort for love forever

losss
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/losss.html

We all are struggling
Just doing our best
We've gone through the grinder
Suffered loss
Loss to, to which everything flows
An absence which
Attracts floral blooming softly

Soft is my chest
I didn't allow loss
Loss make me hate
Didn't harden from pain
This pain we have
Will always be there
But the sense of full satisfaction too

I opened my heart to you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
Finally vulnerable

Loss of love we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we, who we are
It defines us how we overcome it
Recover repair from loss

Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac

I opened my heart for you
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
Finally vulnerable...

It's. Oh. So quiet
It's. Oh. So still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until...

You fall in love
Zing boom
The sky up above
Zing boom
Is caving in
Wow bam
You've never been so nuts about a guy
You wanna laugh you wanna cry
You cross your heart and hope to die

'Til it's over and then
It's nice and quiet
But soon again
Starts another big riot

You blow a fuse
Zing boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing boom
So what's the use
Wow bam
Of falling in love

It's. Oh. So quiet
It's. Oh. So still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until...

You ring the bell
Bim bam
You shout and you yell
Hi ho ho
You broke the spell
Gee. This is swell you almost have a fit
This guy is &quot;gorge&quot; and i got hit
There's no mistake this is it

'Til it's over and then
It's nice and quiet
But soon again
Starts another big riot

You blow a fuse
Zing boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing boom
So what's the use
Wow bam
Of falling in love

The sky caves in
The devil cuts loose
You blow blow blow blow blow your fuse
When you've fallen in love

Ssshhhhhh...

A juxtapositioning fate
Find our mutual coordinate

Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last the view is fierce
All that matters is

Who is open chested
And who has coagulated
Who can share
And who has shut down the chances

Show me emotional respect
I have emotional needs
I wish to synchronize our feelings

What is it that I have
That makes me feel your pain
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it

Who is open
And who has shut up
And if one feels closed
How does one stay open

We have emotional need
I wish to synchronize our feelings
Show some emotional respect

gloomysunday
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjork/gloomysunday.html

Sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
Dearest of shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy Sunday, with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, I know
Let them not weep, let them know, that I'm glad to go

Death is a dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul, I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I awake and I find you asleep and deep in my heart
Dear...
Darling, I hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

Gloomy Sunday
It's absolutely gloomy Sunday
Gloomy Sunday
[end]
