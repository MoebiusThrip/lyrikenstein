Dad

Dead

Was I ever alive?

Fucking makes you alive in one minute

Solctice

I am solctice filled with mercury

Liquid fucked

See right through your heart

Fuck your heart

I am mercury liquid pure

Hot, alive, dead, mucked fish eyes, doe eys

I was born alive

I'll fucking kill you

I'll beat your soft baby head with my own hand

Careful with that baby...

Don't ever say the h word around him

Ashamed

I am ashamed of my name

Say it

I hate the sound of your shit because it means no good

It means cheap, liar, smartass piece of shit

Change it to raygun you fuck

Billy is the loon

I am the loon

I am mars

Billy addly addly addly...

Your name causes shit

While I may be no expert on this reality,

There is no god, but shame

god is hurt, god is cold

Try that once, god is dead

There is not another one

Battle

Cold heart radio

Feedback

The pain

Recurring messages of badness

Recurring living bad dreams at the vortex of lost souls

Wailing lost souls of shame

We are in one hole

Like a cup of mercury phosphate

Brrr

Shuddering around

Taste my shit you wench

Lifting, wailing lost souls who stand a chance

Hot, my eyes darkly gaze and wonder

Do not enter

Why?

I was born whole

Fractured, divided, shattered into a billion fragments

A million piece puzzle

A million piece jigsaw puzzle with no this, and no that

rocket

Bleed in your own light

Dream of your own life

I miss me

I miss everything I'll never be

And on, and on 


I torch my soul to show

The world that I am pure

Deep inside my heart

No more lies


A crown of horns

An image formed deformed

The mark I've borne

A mark of scorn to you


Consume my love, devour my hate

Only powers my escape

The moon is out the, stars invite

I think i'll leave tonight


So soon I'll find myself alone

To relax and fade away

Do you know what's coming down

Do you know I couldn't stay free?


I shall be free

I shall be free

I shall be free

I shall be free

I shall be free free

Free of those voices inside me

I shall be free

I shall be free

Whenever I run 

Whenever I run to you lost one 

It's never done 

Just hanging on 


Just past has let me be 

Returning as if dream 

Shattered as belief 


If you have to go don't say goodbye 

If you have to go don't you cry 

If you have to go I will get by 

Someday I'll follow you and see you on the other side 


But for the grace of love 

I'd will the meaning of 

Heaven from above 


Your picture out of time 

Left aching in my mind 

Shadows kept alive 


If you have to go don't say goodbye 

If you have to go don't you cry 

If you have to go I will get by 

I will follow you and see you on the other side 


But for the grace of love 

I'd will the meaning of 

Heaven from above 


Long horses we are born 

Creatures more than torn 

Mourning our way home

You and me 

Meant to be 

Immutable 

Impossible 

It's destiny 

Pure lunacy 

Incalculable 

Insufferable 

But for the last time 

You're everything that I want and ask for 

You're all that I'd dreamed 

Who wouldn't be the one you love 

Who wouldn't stand inside your love 

Protected and the lover of 

A pure soul and beautiful you 

Don't understand 

Don't feel me now 

I will breathe 

For the both of us 

Travel the world 

Traverse the skies 

Your home is here 

Within my heart 

And for the first time 

I feel as though I am reborn 

In my mind 

Recast as child and mystic sage 

Who wouldn't be the one you love 

Who wouldn't stand inside your love 

And for the first time 

I'm telling you how much I need and bleed for 

Your every move and waking sound 

In my time 

I'll wrap my wire around your heart and your mind 

You're mine forever now 

Who wouldn't be the one you love and live for 

Who wouldn't stand inside your love and die for 

Who wouldn't be the one you love

disarm

Disarm you with a smile

And cut you like you want me to

Cut that little child

Inside of me and such a part of you

Ooh, the years burn 


I used to be a little boy

So old in my shoes

And what i choose is my choice

What's a boy supposed to do?

The killer in me is the killer in you

My love

I send this smile over to you


Disarm you with a smile

And leave you like they left me here

To wither in denial

The bitterness of one who's left alone

Ooh, the years burn

Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn


I used to be a little boy

So old in my shoes

And what I choose is my voice

What's a boy supposed to do?

The killer in me is the killer in you

My love

I send this smile over to you


The killer in me is the killer in you

Send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you

Send this smile over to you

The killer in me is the killer in you

Send this smile over to you

I don't love you for what it's worth
So if you're leaving can you hurt
Cherry blossom, this is goodbye
Come here lately and you fly

When they say what it's worth
The world tells you first
Then you know where to hurt
The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so 
The world's on fire, so have you heard 

Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
Lover let me please, be the one
Know the prayers to make
Flowers made to fade
And when this world to wait
It'll wait for us

The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so 
The world's on fire, so have you heard 

Yes I loved you as a matter of fact
You first are wrapped up, and that's that

Lover let me please
Fall on down your knees
You once made me smile 
When you strayed

The world's on fire, so
The world's on fire, so 
The world's on fire, so have you heard 
The world's on fire
The world's on fire
The world's on fire, have you heard 

Lover have you breathed
To make for your alief (To make for your belief)
So I'm no longer here by your side
What's to hide

The world's on fire
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Monday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Tuesday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Wednesday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Thursday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Friday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Saturday)
The world's on fire (Until I'm ready on Sunday)

Sleep will not come to this tired body now

Peace will not come to this lonely heart

There are some things I'll live without

But I want you to know that I need you right now

I need you tonite

I steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves

Cause I'll always miss her wherever she goes

And I'll always need her more than she could ever need me

I need someone to ease my mind

But sometimes a someone is so hard to find

And I'll do anything to keep her here tonite

And I'll say anything to make her feel alright

And I'll be anything to keep her here tonite

Cause I want you to stay, with me

I need you tonite

She comes to me like an angel out of time

As I play the part of a saint on my knees

There are some things I'll live without

But I want you to know that I need you right now

Suffer my desire

Suffer my desire

Suffer my desire for you

Say hello before you say goodbye

I should go before you make me cry

She wants to bleed every drop inside of me

But I am to please the little girl inside of me, too 


Yeah, yeah

You know i hate to say it

Oh no, I always stay

I don't want to be like the others, please


Who is sorry now?

Who is sorry now?

If I show you how,

Will you let me down?


Slit my wrists and die a whore

Love to love to love what you adore

I can give you anything,

But please let me be your everything

You lose


Yeah, yeah

You know I hate to say it

Oh no, I always stay

I don't wanna be like the others, please


Who is sorry now?

If I show you how,

Will you let me down?

Will you let me down?

Who is sorry now?

Who is sorry now?


My love is weakness

My love is oh so wrong

My love is sadness

My love is oh so strong

My teeth are razor sharp

My love is fucking strong

I'll be with you

But not for long


Oh, oh, oh


Yeah, yeah

You know I hate to say it

Oh no, I always stay

I don't wanna be like the others, please


Who is sorry now?

I spin off and lose my head

Throwing stray a spark instead

Gather strenghth down in my heel

And dig it in the world I peel 


Way down deep within my heart

Lies a soul that's torn apart

Tell me, tell me what your after

I just want to get there faster


I don't live - I inhale

I don't give - I unveil

Don't want to live in your misery

I don't live - I inhale


Sprinkle all my kisses on your head

Stars full of wishes fill our beds

She said, &quot;I'm dead&quot;


All this pain smothers me

Like a bomb that you can't see

Tell me, tell me what your after

I just want to get there faster


I don't live - I inhale

I don't give - I unveil

I don't live - I inhale

I don't live

Freak out
And give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool
And be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know
Who is righteous, what is bold
So I'm told

Who wants honey
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Come align for the big fight to rock for you
But beware
All those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down
They are frightened and they're scared
If you don't stare

Who wants honey
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out

Tell me all of your secrets
Cannot help but believe this is true
Tell me all of your secrets
I know, I know, I know
Should have listened when I was told

Who wants that honey
As long as there is some money
Who wants that honey?

Let me out
Let me out
Let me out
Let me out

Fool enough to almost be it

Cool enough to not quite see it

Doomed

Pick your pockets full of sorrow

And run away with me tomorrow

June 


We'll try and ease the pain

But somehow we'll feel the same

Well, no one knows

Where our secrets go


I send a heart to all my dearies

When your life is so, so dreary

Dream

I'm rumored to the straight and narrow

While the harlots of my perils

Scream


And I fail

But when I can, I will

Try to understand

That when I can, I will


Mother weep the years I'm missing

All our time can't be given

Back

Shut my mouth and strike the demons

That cursed you and your reasons

Out of hand and out of season

Out of love and out of feeling

So bad


When I can, I will

Words defy the plan

When I can, I will


Fool enough to almost be it

And cool enough to not quite see it

And old enough to always feel this

Always old, I'll always feel this


No more promise no more sorrow

No longer will I follow

Can anybody hear me

I just want to be me

When I can, I will

Try to understand

That when I can, I will

I hear your winter

I hear your rain

I've failed your summer ways

And I feel no pain 


I hear what you want

And I feel that way

I hear what you want

And I feel that way


I hear you fade away

And I hear you crawl

I gave my life away

And I feel no pain

And I feel no pain

And I feel no pain

And I feel your pain


And she was my lover so sweet

And she was my angel

And what I've recovered of me

I put into a box underneath my bed


When you lie in your bed

And you lie to yourself

When you lie in your bed

And you lie to yourself

Lie

Lie


Bang bang your dead hole in your head

Bang bang your dead hole in your head

Bang bang your dead hole in your head

Bang bang your dead hole in your head


I hear what you want

And I feel that way

I hear what you want

And I feel that way


(This take, don't give a fuck)

Boredoms in the bathroom shaking out the loose teeth

Sally's in the stirrups claiming her destiny

And nobody nowhere understands anything

About me and all my dreams

Lost at sea

Jack it up judy set your heart alight

Mayfair mistress of the satellites

Misspent youth- faking up a rampage

To hold off the real slaves

Paid off and staid

And what you never knew

Can never get to you

So fake it

I'll be your stumbleine

I'll be your super queen

And make you

Jukebox fuckup hanging round the drugstore

No matter what you say he'll be back for more

Mommy's in the manger with the little kids

She's got her reasons, got my forgets

Of tears and idle threats

Misplaced

And no matter what they do

They can't get to you

So fake it

I'll be your stumbleine

I'll be your super queen

And make you me

Come around ruby I could never sleep alone

Nothing left to say

And all I've left to do

Is run away

From you

And she led me on, down

With secrets I can't keep 


Close your eyes and sleep

Don't wait up for me

Hush now don't you speak

To me


Wrapped my hurt in you

And took my shelter in that pain

The opiate of blame

Is your broken heart, your heart


So now I'm all by myself

As I've always felt

I'll betray my tears

To anyone caught in our ruse of fools


One last kiss from me...yeah

One last kiss good night


Didn't want to lose you once again

Didn't want to be your friend

Fulfilled a promise made of tin

And crawled back to you


I'm all by myself

As I've always felt

I'll betray myself

To anyone, lost, anyone but you


So let the sadness come again

On that you can depend on me, yeah

Until the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeah

When god sleeps in bliss


And I'm all by myself

As I've always felt

And I'll betray myself

To anyone
[end]
