(ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)

We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell.
And maybe we'll come back
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground (leaving ground)
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown.
The final countdown

Oh!

We're heading for Venus (Venus)
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us (seen us)
And welcome us all, yeah.
With so many light years to go
And things to be found (to be found)
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.

It's the final countdown...
The final count down 
[2x]

The final count down
Oh!

It's the final count down
The final count down 
[2x]

It's the final count down
We're leaving together
The final count down
We'll all miss her so.
It's the final count down.

Oh!
It's the final count down.

dangeronthetrack
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/europe/dangeronthetrack.html

I was heading for the mountains
I had saved so much for you
And in the town I left behind me
There was nothing left to do.

I knew that you were waiting
For me to share your life
Cause I told you when I left, that
When I come back you'll be my wife.

But someone was waiting
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waiting
It just didn't feel right.

Danger on the track
Something told me there were
Strangers on my back
And I was so right.

Maybe I should surrender
Maybe I should give it up
But the strength I had inside
Told me you can never stop.

The men wanted to break me
Steal and bring me down
But I fought for you and later
They were lying on the ground.

Hey you should know by now
I'm gonna take you down
Can't keep me out forever
'Cause now I'm back around
Put your best defense
I've made up my mind
I ain't like the others
I'm gonna make you mine

I'm gonna keep on knockin'
Knockin' like before
'Til my heart beats down your door
I'm gonna keep on comin'
Comin' back for more
'Til my heart
'Til my heart beats down your door

Baby you know you love me
So why do you pretend
When I could make you happy
If you just let me in
Well I remember better days
With you by my side
I'll keep you warm forever
And if it takes all night
[end]
heartofstone
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/europe/heartofstone.html

I've told you once and I've told you twice
Wait for that day, when our love will rise
To that song that brought our hearts together.

Even though you're mistreating me
I know the girl that you used to be
For me those days were meant to last forever.

Time after time I'm wondering why
Am I to be all alone
Day after day I pray that you'll stay
Cause you've got a heart of stone.

I walk the streets like a broken man
Oh I wish that you would understand
Even though you're still the one I wait for.

I guess in love there's no guarantee
Sometimes it's not what it seems to be
Even though you're still the one I care for.

Oh who took that shot
Well I couldn't say, I was already down
Oh who set me up
Well I couldn't say cause I saw no one around

Now I'm lyin' here in desperation
I had it all worked out
Everything I hear is consolation
I've got this feelin' you should never say die

In my fantasy
There were days to come that I wanted so bad
Someone sold me out then it all was done
That dream was all that I had

Now I'm lyin' here in desperation...

Oh who took that shot...

Now I'm lyin' here in desperation...

ninja
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/europe/ninja.html

Tell me the story, tell me the legend
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time,
What it was like before
Bring me the feeling, right in that moment
When a heart for battle cries
Find me the treasure where the legend lies.

If I were a noble ancient knight
I'd stand by jour side to rule and fight
It will always feel the same
When I call out your name.

Ninja survive, in dreams I walk by your side
Ninja survive, with you there's no need to hide.

A handful of sayings are more than a reason
For me to feel this way
I'd like to be near you
Maybe for just one day
So tell me the legend, tell me the story
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time
What it was like before.

inthefuturetocome
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/europe/inthefuturetocome.html

So many years ago the people on this earth
They were laughin'
They didn't think of anything else
Than love and peace
But generations failed to see
That they were causin'
Trouble for the future
They didn't know that one single war
Would continue to increase

But I'll be beside you
Cause I want to hide you
I'll cover my pain
Or I'll go insane
Oh Lord where will it end
When tomorrow is done
Oh Lord can we stop to pretend
That we can survive in the future to come

As long as you can see
As long as you can feel
There's no cause for alarm
As long as you can touch
As long as you can move
It ain't too bad
But one day or another
This world would maybe
Be destroyed forever
A holocaust maybe be spread
And drive us all mad

When lights go down, I see no reason
For you to cry. We've been through this before
In every time, in every season,
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more.

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again,
Somewhere again

I read your mind, with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time, whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, oh things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again

Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye

Carrie, Carrie, oh things they change Carrie Carrie Carrie
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again
Oh somewhere, again

When lights go down
[end]
