Will you call on me
If I turn my back on you
Fall into the river
Just keep on swimmin'

I'm lookin for answers to
my wishes and my prayers
You missed most of the words
When I said 'em

I am a believer
Right on the brink of thinkin'
I cannot be so easily brought to my knees
So, baby you need to

Row your boat a little bit faster now
Oh, turn around and I'll be
A stranger in the crowd

I am believe now that ain't thinkin' straight
And I ain't gonna wait for the sun to set
One more mile

I am a believer
Right on the brink of thinkin'
I cannot be so easily bright to my knees
So, baby

Go for broke or lay lay yourself down on the road
Let help pay way as you sit there and smoke, drink and daydream

I'm a vision you looked for so long at your door, sweetheart
My ears are ringing, a ring-ringin' like my mind is, oh

I am a believer, but through receiving his oath, sat on the floor
The hum and the buzz I can't take it no more

I am a believer, but through receiving his oath, sat on the floor
The hum and the buzz I can't take it no more

She upset the weather
She upset my sweet cloud
Growing black
Thick and heavy
Strike me now gonna put me down

She upset my brother
She upset his sweetheart
I love him so I do not kill
I know no words to make it right

I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive 

Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool 

She upset his morning
She upset his afternoon
I see no way
I see no right
The night calls it stays on the night 
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing

I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive 

Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool

Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool
Lost a lot of blood
Lost a lot of cool cool cool

I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive 
I know no words to fix my killing
But I'll do anything to bring my brother alive 

I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing
I know no words to fix my killing

You don't own the road boy
Better kick up a storm
You don't own the big city lights
Better cop out your own

You don't own the green pines,
The blue sky, or the smoke
You don't own the dust in your
Big brown eyes when you keep them closed

Yeah, steal them back for me love
Oh yeah, steal them back for me love, oh yeah

You don't own the road boy
And neither do I
You don't own the big city lights
That make my eyes cry

You don't own the green pines
So be careful where you lean
And when you're lost under the blue sky
Look down and you'll find me

Yeah, steal it back for me love
Oh yeah steal it back for me love, oh yeah

Come on over
If that's the way you feel
When you're lonesome steal it
Back when you're lonely
Back when you're lonely, back

You don't own the sadness son
See the tide just comes in
Guilt is played on the violin
By those who never cared to sing

Yeah, steal it back for me love
Oh yeah, steal it back for me love, back for me love
Oh yeah, steal it back for me love, back for me love
Oh yeah, steal it back for me love, back for me love
Back for me love
Back for me love

Baby save it, we're wasted
I know we gotta slow it down
But when the waves come, you face them
And you know we can't stop it now

Heads up we're in a dead club
Put your hands up and do your dipsy and dropsy
And line up, we're hanging up
We're double sixing it, night after night
Doing it to death

Baby lately the plans we're making
Are the shape of things that never come
Hold your horses, the lights up
Can't feel it coming back around

Listen up, it's picking up
Put your hands up and do your kicksy and lipsy
Your times up, we're hanging up
We're double sixing it, night cause tonight
We're doing it to death

We're double sixing it night after night after night 
[x3]

Doing it to death

You're gonna have to step over my dead body
Before you walk out that door
You charmed me with your magic
Landed looking tragic
&quot;Forever&quot; is the feather you ain't got no more

And all the people you see coming by to save you
You're make-believing-on in your mind
Your eyes are holy rollin', looking, beating, knocking
The ceiling gets closer to you all the time

This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more

You're gonna have to step over my dead body
Before you walk out that door
You charmed me with your magic
Landed looking tragic
&quot;Forever&quot; is the feather you ain't got no more

This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more
This ain't no wow no more

Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end of the night

Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end of the night

Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end at the end of the night

Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like
Drip drip drip drip drip kinda' like the loose end at the end of the night

This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore

This ain't no wow now
They all been put down
Who ain't dead yet, fled to die closer to the shore

This ain't no wow now
They all been put down

This ain't no wow now
They all been put down

There ain't no wow now ...

Cut your branches at the root
That long have grown that bitter fruit
Cut your branches at the root
That only gave me bitter fruit

I was conceived in a red cage, from a wild love
I am the seed of a dead age, gone viral
Those feelings I've tried to shake, all my life long
But the demons I'm keeping are hard to face
When you hide them, so long

I gotta cut you at the root
I gotta save my soul from the bad in you
I gotta cut you through and through
You only ever gave me bitter fruit

Oh and it grew like a shockwave
And I was blindsided, oh oh
The fruit that your love gave
Poisoned my mind up, oh oh

I cut your branches at the root
I gotta save my soul from the things you do
I cut your branches through and through
But still I only taste that bitter fruit

Down to the bone
All my love was cut in a single blow
Gone, and I know
All my love was cut in the seed I sowed

I could pray, but can't you see
The kind of things I pray for are cursing me
I could pray, but can't you see
The kind of things I pray for
The kind of things I need

I cut your branches at the root
That only ever gave me bitter fruit
I cut your branches through and through
But still I only taste that bitter fruit

I could pray, but can't you see
The kind of things I pray for are cursing me
I could pray, but can't you see
The kind of things I pray for
The kind of things I need

Cut your branches at the root
That long have grown that bitter fruit
Cut your branches at the root
That only gave me bitter fruit

Cut your branches at the root
That long have grown that bitter fruit
Cut your branches at the root
That only gave me bitter fruit
