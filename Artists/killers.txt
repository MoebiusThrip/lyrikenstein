A lovestruck Romeo, sings the streets of serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Find a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, &quot;You and me, babe, how about it?&quot;

Juliet says, &quot;Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack&quot;
He's underneath the window, she's singing
Hey, la, my boyfriend's back&quot;
You shouldn't come around here, singing up at people like that
Anyway what you gonna do about it?

Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet that you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dream your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me, as if I was just another one of your deals?

Well, you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say, &quot;Oh, Romeo, yeah, you know
I used to have a scene with him&quot;

Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry
I said, &quot;I love you like the stars above, I love you 'til I die.&quot;
And there's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

I can't do the talk like the talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time

Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry
I said, &quot;I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die.&quot;
And there's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

A lovestruck Romeo, he sings the streets of serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
He says something like, &quot;You and me, babe, how about it?&quot;

missatomicbomb

You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirls' lies

When I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out, we've got the radio on
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
And for a second there we'd won
Yeah, we were innocent and young

Cast out of the night, well you've got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Your soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burnin' for love
Holdin on' for your life

All that I wanted was a little touch,
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we've got the radio on
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows in the moonlight
We're taking chances on a hot night
And for a second there we'd won
Yeah we were innocent and young

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you're too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate

It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back (It's so cruel 
[?]
)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack (and you turn your back, you're so)
Your soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black (on a losing game)
You should have seen your little face, burning for love,
(Miss Atomic Bomb) Holdin' on for your life

But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)
When you want it all (A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)
There's another side (Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)

thewayitwas
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/thewayitwas.html

I drove through the desert last night
I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing &quot;don't be cruel&quot;
And I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under

Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind

If I go on
With you by my side
Can it be
The way it was
When we met
Did you forget all about those golden nights?

Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving
In my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust

If I go on
With you by my side
Can it be
The way it was
When we met
Did you forget all about those golden nights?
(The way it was)

All of our plans have fallen through
Sometimes a dream, it don't come true

Darling!
Darling!

If we go on
Can it be
The way it was
When we met
Did you forget all about them golden nights?

If I go on
With you by my side
Can it be
The way it was
My heart is true
Girl, it's just you
I'm thinking of
Can it be the way it was?

Maybe a thief stole your heart

The emotion it was electric 

And the stars, they all aligned 

I knew I had to make my decision 

But I never made the time 

No, I never made the time 


In the dark, for a while now 

I can't stay, so far 

I can't stay much longer 

Riding my decision home 


Exoneration lost his eraser 

But my forgiver found the sun 

And there are twisted days that I take comfort 

Cause I'm not the only one 

No, I'm not the only one 


In the dark, for a while now 

I can't stay very far 

I can't stay much longer 

Riding my decision home 


There is a majesty at my doorstep 

There is a little boy in her arms 

Now we'll parade around without game plans 

Obligation or alarm 


In the dark, for a while now 

I can't stay very far 

I can't stay much longer 

Riding my decision home 


In the dark, for a while now 

I can't stay so far 

I can't stay much longer 

Riding my decision home 

In the dark

tranquilize

Time it tells living in my home town, 

Wedding bells they begin easy

Live it down, baby don't talk that much,

Baby knows, but baby don't tease me.

In the park we could go walking,

Drown in the dark or we could go sailing

On the sea


Always here, always on time

Close call, was it love or was it just easy

Money talks when people need shoes and socks,

Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me


I was just sipping on something sweet

I don't need political process


I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door

I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more

See I was thinking that I lost my mind

But it's been getting to me all this time

And it don't stop dragging me down


Silently reflection turns my world to stone

Patiently correction leaves us all alone

And sometimes I'm a travel man

But tonight this engine's failing


I still hear the children playing


Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack

Steal a car and ring a round-rosey, 

Rock and roll, candyland, boogeyman, 

Run away and give me your sneakers


Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain

We began the weeping and wailing

A hurried high from pestilence, pills and pride,

It's a shame, we could of gone sailing

But heaven knows,

Heaven knows everything

Tranquilize


I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door

I got this feeling they they're gonna come back for more

See I was thinking that I lost my mind

But it's been getting to me all this time

And it don't stop dragging me down


Silently reflection turns my world to stone

Patiently correction leaves us all alone

And sometimes I'm travel man

But tonight this engine's failing


I still hear the children playing

Dead beat dancers come to us and stay


Cause i don't care where you've been

And I don't care what you've seen

We're the ones who still believe

And we're looking for a page

In that lifeless book of hope

Where a dream might help you cope

With the Bushes and the bombs

A-re, Tranquilized

I believe in you and me

I'm coming to find you

If it takes me all night

Wrong until you make it right

And I won't forget you

At least I'll try

And run, and run tonight

Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright


I wasn't shopping for a doll

To say the least, I thought I've seen them all

But then you took me by surprise

I'm dreaming bout those dreamy eyes

I never knew, I never knew

So take your suitcase, cause I don't mind

And baby doll, I meant it every time

You don't need to compromise

I'm dreaming bout those dreamy eyes

I never knew, I never knew

But it's alright...


Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright

Everything will be alright

Leaves are falling down

On the beautiful ground

I heard a story from the man in red

He said the leaves are falling down

Such a beautiful sound

Son, I think you better go ahead


But you always hold your head up high

Cause it's a long, long, long way down

This town was meant for passing through

But it ain't nothing new

Now go and show them

That the world stayed round

But it's a long, long, long way down


You better run for the hills before they burn

Listen to the sound of the world

And watch it turn

I just want to show you what I know

And catch you when the current lets you go

Or should I just get along with myself


I never did get along with everybody else

I've been trying hard to do what's right

But you know I could stay here all night

And watch the clouds fall from the sky


This river is wild

This river is wild


Run for the hills before they burn

Listen to the sound of the world

Watch it turn

But shake a little

Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk

I shake a little

Sometimes i hate the line I walk

I just want to show you what I know

And catch you when the current lets you go


Or should I just get along with myself

I never did get along with everybody else

Ive been trying hard to do whats right

But you know I could stay here all night

And watch the clouds fall

From the sky


Because this river is wild

God speed you boy

This river is wild


Now Adam's taking bombs

And he's stuck on his mom

Because that bitch

Keeps trying to make him pray


He's with the hippie in the park

Coming over the dark

Just trying to get some of that little girl play


You better run for the hills before they burn

Listen to the sound of the world

But watch it turn

I just want to show you what I know

And catch you when the current lets you go


Or should I get along with myself

I never did get along with everybody else

I've been trying hard to do whats right

But you know I could stay here all night

And watch the clouds fall from the sky


And pay this hell in me tonight

Because this river is wild

God speed you boy

This river is wild

God speed you boy

This river is wild


Now the cards are everywhere face in dust

The fairground

I don't think I ever seen so many headlights

But there's something pulling me

The circus and the crew

Well they're just passing through

Making sure the merry still goes round

But it's a long, long, long way down

human
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/human.html

I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought but I was kind

And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart
Cut the cord

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Hear my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could

And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've gotta let me go

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

You've gotta let me know

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Are we human or are we dancer?
Are we human or are we dancer?

Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you

'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around

Pace yourself for me
I said maybe baby please
But I just don't know now
When all I wanna do is try


[x3]
Somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential

I know what you want

I wanna take you a midnight show tonight

If you can keep a secret

I got a blanket in the back seat on my mind

And a little place that sits beneath the sky

She turned her face to speak

But no-one heard her cry

Drive faster, boy

Drive faster, boy


I know there's a hope

There's too many people trying to help me cope

You got a real short skirt

I wanna look up, look up, look up, yeah yeah


We were just in time

Let me take a little more off your mind

There's something in my head

Somewhere in the back said

We were just a good thing

We were such a good thing


Make it go away without a word

But promise me you'll stay

And fix these things I've hurt

Oh make it go away!


Drive faster, boy

Drive faster, boy


Oh crashing tide can't hide a guilty girl

With jealous hearts that start with gloss and curls

I took my baby's breath beneath the chandelier

Of stars in atmosphere

And watch her disappear

Into the midnight show...


Oh faster, faster, faster...

Oh no no no no no...

If you keep a secret

Well baby... you can keep a secret

If you keep a secret...

On the field I remember you were incredible

Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah 

On the match with the boys, you think you're alone

With the pain that you drain from love

In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world

Cause Andy, you're a star 


Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call

Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah

Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall

Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah 


On the streets, such a sweet face jumping in town

In the staff room the verdict is in

In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world

Cause Andy, you're a star

In nobody's eyes but mine

Andy, you're a star

In nobody's eyes but mine

Andy, you're a star

In nobody's eyes

In nobody's eyes but mine

[The Killers]
Well your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph
Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph
There's a pale moonshine, above you
Do you see both sides, do they shove you, around


[Elton John]
Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph
Are the rumors eating you alive, Joseph


[The Killers]
When the holy night is upon you
Will you do what's right, the position is yours


[Elton John]
From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a child
When she took her stand
Did she hold your hand
Will your faith stand still or run away
Run away


[guitar solo]


[Elton John]
When they've driven you so far
That you think you're gonna drop
Do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop


[Neil Tennant]
With the plane and the lathe
The work never drove you mad
You're a maker, a creator
Not just somebody's dad

From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a man
When I take the stand
When I take the stand
Will he hold my hand
Will my faith stand still or run away

(run away)


[Elton John]
And the desert
It's a hell of a place to find heaven
Forty years lost in the wilderness looking for God
And you climb to the top of the mountain
Looking down on the city
Where you were born

(On the years since you left gave you time to sit back and reflect)

Better you than me (Better you than me)
Better you than me
Yes


[The Killers]
Well the Holy night is upon you (Better you than me 
[2x]
)
Do you see both sides, do they shove you, around

Better you than me, Joseph (Better you than me)
Better you than me
Joseph, Joseph, Joseph, Joseph
Than me
Better you than me
Better you than me (Better you, better you, better you)
Than me

Well your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph

You're looking for a way out, I can feel it
Come on, show me where it hurts, maybe I can heal it
Your feelings are your own, now you keep them under lock and key
You've got me driving through the streets for an answer to the mystery

The world's still awake on Charleston Avenue
Outside that vacant starlight motel
I see you
Laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world
Not a burden on your mind

It was a matter of time

There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface
Just walking through the front door makes me nervous
It's creeping up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand
How can I put out the fire? I've got a book of matches in my hand

When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt
Made just enough, hustling tables, that summer to take you out
I was falling back on forever
When you told me about your heart
You laid it on the line

Laughing with your girlfriends
Not a care in the world
Not a burden on your mind
You're hanging on the line!

It was just a matter
It was a matter of time

We'd find ourselves a place, we belong in this forever
Ain't that what it's all about?
Make the promise and keep it
Come hell or high water
We'd figure it out

It was the night, it was the moon
It was the green grass in the garden
The victory and the sin

I know you're weary, look at me
Flailing in the corner
Here's the towel
Go on, throw it in

It was a matter of time
Can't you see that it's tearing me up inside?
Look what's laying at our feet
That's the wreckage of broken dreams
And burned out halos
And it's here on our street

It started with a low light,
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head.
You know that I was hoping,
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open,
I guess I changed my mind.

And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And the zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites

That was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The star maker says, &quot;It ain't so bad.&quot;
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, &quot;Everybody look down
It's all in your mind.&quot;

Well now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give.
You think you might cross over,
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over,
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine,
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim,
And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised

But, it was the turning point,
Oh what a lonely night


[2x]
The star maker says, &quot;It ain't so bad.&quot;
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, &quot;Everybody look down
It's all in your mind.&quot;

My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from East to West,
They say the Nile used to run from East to West.

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes...


[2x]
The star maker says, &quot;It ain't so bad.&quot;
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, &quot;Everybody look down
It's all in your mind.&quot;

It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
[end]
