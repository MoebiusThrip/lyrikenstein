[Daisley - Kerslake - Osbourne - Rhoads]

Screaming at the window
Watch me die another day
Hopeless situation
Endless price I have to pay

Sanity now it's beyond me
There's no choice

Diary of a madman
Walk the line again today
Entries of confusion
Dear diary, I'm here to stay

Manic depression befriends me
Hear his voice
Sanity now it's beyond me
There's no choice

A sickened mind and spirit
The mirror tells me lies
Could I mistake myself for someone
Who lives behind my eyes?
Will he escape my soul
Or will he live in me?
Is he trying to get out
Or trying to enter me?

Voices in the darkness
Scream away my mental health
Can I ask a question
To help me save me from myself?

Enemies fill up the pages
Are they me
Monday 'till Sunday in stages
Set me free
[end]
believer
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ozzyosbourne/believer.html

[Daisley - Osbourne - Rhoads]

Watching the time go
And feeling belief grow
Rise above the obstacles
People beseech me
But they'll never teach me
Things that I already know (I know)

Dreams that have shattered
May not have mattered
Take another point of view
Doubts will arise, though
Like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two (That's true)

You've got to believe in yourself
Or no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying free for you to use (OK baby)

I can't believe they stop and stare 
And point their fingers, doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind
It's just that they won't see

I'm a believer
I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out
I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise
[end]
littledolls
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ozzyosbourne/littledolls.html

[Daisley - Kerslake - Osbourne - Rhoads]

Wrything and screaming
The pain just won't go
He'll show you no mercy
Your image in his hands
It's useless to try
Escaping his curses

The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls

Tortured and flaming
You give birth to hell
Living a nightmare
Feelings of pity
You'll pray for your death
But he's in no hurry

The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls

Nowhere to run
Your fate is in his hands
Your time has come
You'll live to his command
I'm warning you
The worst is yet to come
The killer who
Remains a mystery

I that believe in
The stories of old 
Would never fight it
Vengeance and curses
That play on your soul
Like something ignited

You never imagined
Such a fate could follow you
(You never thought it was true)
And when it's your time
I wonder how you'll do
Your kind of troubles
Running deeper than the sea
You broke the rules
You've been a fool
The little doll is you, yeah

Nowhere to run
Your fate is in his hands
Your time has come
You'll live to his command
I'm warning you
The worst is yet to come
The killer who
Remains a mystery

Wrything and screaming
The pain just won't go
He'll show you no mercy
Your image in his hands
It's useless to try
Escaping his curses

Nowhere to run
Your fate is in his hands
Your time has come
You'll live to his command
I'm warning you
The worst is yet to come
The killer who
Remains a mystery

neversaydie
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ozzyosbourne/neversaydie.html

People going nowhere, taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow White's mirror said &quot;partners in crime!&quot;

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't they ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, `till it's ready, taking it slow

There's no need have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us to die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

wholeworldsfallindown
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ozzyosbourne/wholeworldsfallindown.html

I leave my son the legacy of dangers
The tragedy of synthesizing rhymes
The genocide that comes from total strangers
Apocalyptic dreams to kill mankind

I see the mystery unwind
My spirit's telling me
The sky is dying
And the whole world's falling down

Don't buy your fate
From media messiahs
God gave you breath
Don't blow it all away

I see the misery unwind
You must be stupid or be blind
My spirit's telling me

The sky is crying
Burning holes into the ground
The sky is dying
And the whole world's falling down

Why can't you see or don't you know?
You only reap the seeds you sow
Oh no

I see the misery unwind
You must be stupid or be blind
My spirit's telling me

The sky is crying
Burning holes into the ground
The sky is dying
And the whole world's falling down

Right

The sky is dying
Falling to the ground
The sky is dying
Falling to the ground

The sky is dying
Falling to the ground
The sky is dying
Falling to the ground

[Daisley - Osbourne - Rhoads]

Yesterday has been and gone
Tomorrow will I find the sun
Or will it rain
Everybody's having fun
Except me, I'm the lonely one
I live in shame

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

I've been the king, I've been the clown
Now broken wings can't hold me down
I'm free again
The jester with the broken crown
It won't be me this time around
To love in vain

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

And I feel the time is right
Although I know that you just might say to me
What'cha gonna do
What'cha gonna do
But I have to take this chance goodbye
To friends and to romance
And to all of you
And to all of you
Come on now

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

And the weather's looking fine
And I think the sun will shine again
And I feel I've cleared my mind
All the past is left behind again

I say goodbye to romance, yeah
Goodbye to friends, I tell you
Goodbye to all the past
I guess that we'll meet
We'll meet in the end

[Ozzy Osbourne, Zakk Wylde]

Time after time
I guess that love is blind
I couldn't read your mind
Line after line
Line after line
It was written in your eyes
I guess it's no surprise
Time after time
I can hear them whispering
Shadows in the rain
Thinking how it might have been
Time after time
Line after line, you broke me
Day after day
I watched love fade away
I wanted love to stay
Day after day
The games we play
The foolish things we say
The pain won't go away
Day after day
Candlelight are shimmering
Shadows on the wall
Thinking how it might have been

theultimatesin
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ozzyosbourne/theultimatesin.html

[Daisley - Osbourne - Williams]

Overkill, enough is enough
There's nothing left of me to devour
You've had your fill, I'm all I have left
What can stop your hunger for power?

'Cos you took advantage
Of things that I said
Now the feeling is dead
And that's the ultimate sin
And that's the ultimate sin

Anyway I look at it now
The doors are closed and cannot be opened
Bury your anger and bury your dead
Or you'll be left with nothing and no one

There's no point in screaming
'Cos you won't be heard
Now the tables have turned
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin
It was the ultimate sin

I warned you then and I'm warning you now
If you mess with me you're playing with fire
Winds of change that are fanning the flames
Will carry you to your funeral pyre

It's pulling you down
It's your final descent
It's too late to repent
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin
When it's the ultimate sin

When it's the ultimate sin
