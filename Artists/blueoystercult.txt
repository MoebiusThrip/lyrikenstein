astronomy

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reason tends to fly away

Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sands become a crust
And most of you have gone away

Come Susy dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where the winds come from

Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the four winds bar

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door let to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms 
[repeat twice]

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Suzy dear
Would find themselves at the four winds bar

It's the nexus of the crisis
The origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Call me Desdenova, eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

Astronomy...a star 
[repeat indefinitely]

Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies

Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what to do
Is it any wonder that the joke's an iron
And the jokes on you

Experiments that failed too many times
Transformations that were too hard to find
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies

Yes I know the secrets of the iron and mind
They're trinity acts a mineral fire
Yes I know the secrets of the circuitry mind
It's a flaming wonder telepath

Well I've opened up my veins too many times
And the poison's in my heart and in my mind
Poison's in my bloodstream, poison's in my pride
I'm after rebellion, I'll settle for lies

Is it any wonder that my mind's on fire
Imprisoned by the thoughts of what to do
Is it any wonder that the joke's an iron
And the jokes on you

And the joke's on you 
[repeat ad infinitum]

All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain... we can be like they are
Come on baby... don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand... don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly... don't fear the reaper
Baby I'm your man...

La la la la la
La la la la la

Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity... Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday... Like Romeo and Juliet
40,000 men and women everyday... Redefine happiness
Another 40,000 coming everyday... We can be like they are
Come on baby... don't fear the reaper
Baby take my hand... don't fear the reaper
We'll be able to fly... don't fear the reaper
Baby I'm your man...

La la la la la
La la la la la

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared... saying don't be afraid
Come on baby... and she had no fear
And she ran to him... then they started to fly
They looked backward and said goodbye... she had become like they are
She had taken his hand... she had become like they are
Come on baby... don't fear the reaper

veins
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blueoystercult/veins.html

I open my eyes from a dreamless night
With a sense of dread you could cut with a knife
Still I'm thinking that maybe I killed somebody
Never know, never know when
Might have killed somebody

Veins in my eyeballs
Damage that I've done
Veins on the stairways
Veins in my skull

I visit my friend
We have a fight
I'm drinking his whiskey
I'm wanting his wife
Then the image goes black,
Did I kill somebody
Cause there ain't no clues, no clues
That I killed somebody

Veins in my eardrums
Banging at my door
Veins in my brainwaves
Veins on the floor

I get the shivers and I've got the shakes
People screamin' my name
like there's no mistake
Can't believe it's true
That I killed somebody
But I just don't know, don't know
Did I kill somebody

Veins on the sidewalk
Veins know the score
Veins in my mind, ohhhhhh
Veins evermore...

Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
In the '50s Ray Milland pierced the skies

Do not envy who sees and plucks out his eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes

You think you want
You want to see 
Through all the lies
You think you'd like 
To see past death
With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes

Do not envy who sees beyond the pale
Don't look there, pluck not at nature's veil
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes

You think you want 
To see the truth
But if you knew 
You can't undo
You'd look away
With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes x-ray eyes

Do not lift the veil of the skies
Do not lift the veil of the skies
Do not lift the veil of the skies
Do not lift the veil of the skies

Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes

With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
With x-ray eyes x-ray eyes
X-ray eyes 

Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes
Do not envy the man with the x-ray eyes

http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blueoystercult/thegreatsunjester.html

They have killed the great sun jester
Who danced between the stars
They have stripped him of his manhood
Signs of Venus and of Mars
The cynics left him weeping
And the jackals left him torn
And the jester reaches out bind hands
He can touch the stars no more.


[CHORUS:]
And he took the stars in his hands
And as he scattered them he'd shout
&quot;I'm the joker of the universe
I'm what it's all about.&quot;
Now he's dying in his grief
And the hard men dragged him down
They have killed the wild-eyed jester
They have killed the fireclown

Now his blind eyes seek the starlight
And his fingers seek controls
To take him into space again
Where he was both young and old
The dancers stiff with pain
And they've made him kneel too long
And the madness they have driven out
They've left him cold and sane.


[CHORUS]

He'll never - sing his songs - again....
He'll never dance between the stars - again....
He'll never laught - again....
No he'll never ever laugh again....
Oh, no....

With satan's hog no pig at all, and the weather getting dry
We'll head south from altamont in a cold blooded travelled trance
So clear the road my bully boys and let some thunder pass
We're pain, we're steel, a plot of knives,
We're transmaniacon MC

Behind the pantry, behind the tree, the ghouls adopt that child
Whose name resounds forever, whose name resounds on terror
And I'm no fool to call that hog, cause man I remember
Those who did resign their souls
To transmaniacon MC

And surely we did offer up behind that stage at dawn
Beers and barracuda, reds and monocaine
Pure nectar of antipathy behind that stage at dawn
To those who would resign their souls
To transmaniacon MC

Cry the cable, cry the word, unknown terror's here
And won't you try this tasty snack, behind the scenes or but the back
Which was the stage at altamont, my humble boys of listless power:
We're pain, we're steel, a plot of knives
We're transmaniacon MC

Junkies down in Brooklyn are going crazy
They're laughing just like hungry dogs in the street
Policemen are hiding behind the skirts of little girls
Their eyes have turned the color of frozen meat

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave

Catholic schoolgirls have thrown away their mascara
They chain themselves to the axles of big Mack trucks
The sky is filled with herds of shivering angels
The fat lady laughs, "Gentlemen, start your trucks!"

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave

Christina
Mother's home No, no, no, no
Christina No, no, no, no, no, no
Come to mother No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Christina No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave

Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave
Joan Crawford has risen
