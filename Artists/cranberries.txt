zombie
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cranberries/zombie.html

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your
Head they are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head,
In your head they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey, hey, oh
Dou, dou, dou, dou
Dou, dou, dou, dou
Dou, dou, dou, dou
Dou, dou, dou, dou

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme since nineteen-sixteen
In your head,
In your head they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head they are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, oh, ya, ya-a

linger
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cranberries/linger.html

If you, if you could return, don't let it burn, don't let it fade. 


I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude, 

It's tearing me apart, It's ruining everything. 


I swore, I swore I would be true, and honey, so did you. 

So why were you holding her hand? Is that the way we stand? 

Were you lying all the time? Was it just a game to you? 


But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you. 

You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 

Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 

Do you have to let it linger? 


Oh, I thought the world of you. 

I thought nothing could go wrong, 

But I was wrong. I was wrong. 

If you, if you could get by, trying not to lie, 

Things wouldn't be so confused and I wouldn't feel so used, 

But you always really knew, I just wanna be with you. 


But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you. 

You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 

Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 

Do you have to let it linger? 


And I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you. 

You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 

Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 

Do you have to let it linger? 


You know I'm such a fool for you. 

You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha. 

Do you have to let it linger? Do you have to, do you have to, 

Do you have to let it linger?

how
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cranberries/how.html

Look, you're standing alone (Standing alone.) 


How ever I should have known, (I should have known.) 

Never before, never again, 

You will ignore, I will pretend. 

Never before, never again, 

You will ignore, I will pretend. 


In your world, you're alone in your face. 

You're alone in your world, you're alone in your face. 

How you said you never would leave me alone, oh. 

How you said you never would leave me alone. 


Now you're just walking away (Walking away), 

When you said you always would stay (Always would stay.) 

Never before, never again, 

You will ignore, I will pretend. 

Never before, never again, 

You will ignore, I will pretend. 


In your world, you're alone in your face. 

You're alone in your world, you're alone in your face. 

How you said you never would leave me alone, oh. 

How you said you never would leave me alone. 


Never before, never again, 

You will ignore, I will pretend. 


In your world, you're alone in your face. 

You're alone in your world, you're alone in your face. 


How you said you never would leave me alone, oh. 

How you said you never would leave me alone

liar
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cranberries/liar.html

Say it if you want to and say it if you will 

But if you don't say what you are thinkin' 

No, I won't take too kindly to it. 


And all I want is something special, 

And you can't give it to me, 

And all you do is lie to me, 

'Cause you're a liar, liar, liar. 


I will run, I will fight, 

I will take you through the night lie, lie, liar, 

I will run, I will fight, 

I will take you through the night lie, lie, liar... 


Say it if you want to, 

And say it if you choose 

But if you don't say what you are thinkin' 

No I won't take too kindly to it 


When all I want is something different 

And you could't give it to me 

And all you do is lie to me 

So you're a liar, liar, liar. 


I will run, I will fight, 

I will take you through the night lie, lie, liar, 

I will run, I will fight, 

I will take you through the night lie, lie, liar... 


I'll fight you, I'll fight you 

I'm fighing you 

Liar, liar, liar 

You know you're a liar, 

Liar...

Terrible thing

It was a terrible thing to see you're dying

It was a terrible thing

It was a terrible thing to see you're dying inside

To see you're dying

Won't you come out

I'll play the game with day

Won't you speak out

I'll say the things you say

The lady loved her gold

The lady lost her soul


It was a terrible thing

It was a terrible thing to see you're dying

It was a terrible thing

It was a terrible thing to see you're dying inside

To see you're dying

Do you remember the things we used to do

Do you remember the way it was for you

The lady loved her gold

The lady lost her soul


It was a terrible thing

It was a terrible thing to see you're dying

It was a terrible thing

It was a terrible thing to see you're dying inside

To see you die

Electric blue eyes where did you come from? 

Electric blue eyes who sent you? 

Electric blue eyes, always be near me. 

Electric blue eyes, I need you. 


Na na no, na na no...

Domine, Adiu, Adiuma Me. 


If you should go you should know I love you. 

If you should go you should know I'm here. 

Always be near me, guardian angel. 

Always be near me, there's no fear. 

(None at all) 


Na na no, na na no...

The truth will ever hide 

Even though I tried 

They tried to take my pride 

But they only took my father from me 

They only took my father 

Even though I cried 

Even though I tried again 


God be with you Ireland 

God be with you Ireland 


Sometimes I was afraid 

Even though I prayed 

I've lost my religion now 

You took that too somehow 

Blood upon thy hands 

Blood upon thy hands again 


(I have served my time) 

God be with you Ireland 

(Suffered for my crime) 

God be with you Ireland 


(I have served my time) 

God be with you Ireland 

(Suffered for my crime) 

God be with you Ireland 


God be with you now 

God be with you now 

God be with you now 

God be with you now
