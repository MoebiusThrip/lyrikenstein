Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.
Desperate to control all and everything.
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.

Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Terrified of being wrong. Ultimatum prison cell.

Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled again.
Humbled again.

Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.
Saturn ascends, comes round again.
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage done.

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.
Desperate to control all and everything.
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.

Wear the grudge like a crown. Desperate to control.
Unable to forgive. And sinking deeper.

Defining, confining, sinking deeper.
Controlling, defining, and we're sinking deeper.

Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Let's you choose what you will, will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.

Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child
Or drags you down like a stone to
Consume you till you choose to let this go.
Choose to let this go.

Give away the stone. Let the oceans take and
Transmutate this cold and fated anchor.
Give away the stone. Let the waters kiss and
Transmutate these leaden grudges into gold.
Let go.

sober
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tool/sober.html

There's a shadow just behind me,
Shrouding every step I take,
Making every promise empty,
Pointing every finger at me.
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests.
Murder now the path of &quot;must we&quot;
Just because the son has come.

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over.
Why can't we drink forever.
I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down.

Mother Mary won't you whisper
Something but the past is done.
Mother Mary won't you whisper
Something but the past is done.

Why can't we not be sober?
Just want to start this over.
Why can't we sleep forever.
I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
Trust me 
[x5]

Why can't we not be sober?
Just want to start things over.
Why can't we sleep forever.
I just want to start this over.

I want what I want

schism
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tool/schism.html

I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end crippling our communication.

I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing.
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

Cold silence
has a tendency
to atrophy any
sense of compassion
between supposed lovers,
between supposed lovers,

I know the pieces fit 
[8x]

Angels on the sideline,
Puzzled and amused.
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused.

Don't these talking monkeys know that
Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys,
Where there's one you're bound to divide it.
Right in two.

Angels on the sideline,
Baffled and confused.
Father blessed them all with reason.
And this is what they choose.
And this is what they choose...

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey
Over pieces of the ground.
Silly monkeys give them thumbs,
They forge a blade,
And where there's one
they're bound to divide it,
Right in two.
Right in two.

Monkey killing monkey killing monkey.
Over pieces of the ground.
Silly monkeys give them thumbs.
They make a club.
And beat their brother, down.
How they survive so misguided is a mystery.

Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to lift an eye to heaven conscious of his fleeting time here.

Cut and divide it all right in two 
[x4]

Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky
Fight over life, over blood, over prayer,
overhead and light
Fight over love, over sun,
over another, Fight for each other,
for the ones who are rising.

Angels on the sideline again.
Benched along with patience and reason.
Angels on the sideline again
Wondering when this tug of war will end.

Cut and divide it all right in two 
[x3]
RIGHT IN TWO!

Right in two...

Eye on the TV

'cause tragedy thrills me

Whatever flavour

It happens to be like;

Killed by the husband

Drowned by the ocean

Shot by his own son

She used the poison in his tea

And kissed him goodbye

That's my kind of story

It's no fun 'til someone dies


Don't look at me like

I am a monster

Frown out your one face

But with the other

Stare like a junkie

Into the TV

Stare like a zombie

While the mother

Holds her child

Watches him die

Hands to the sky crying

Why, oh why?

'cause I need to watch things die

From a distance


Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies

You all need it too, don't lie


Why can't we just admit it?

Why can't we just admit it?


We won't give pause until the blood is flowing

Neither the brave nor bold

The writers of stories sold

We won't give pause until the blood is flowing


I need to watch things die

From a good safe distance


Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies

You all feel the same so

Why can't we just admit it?


Blood like rain come down

Drawn on grave and ground


Part vampire

Part warrior

Carnivore and voyeur

Stare at the transmittal

Sing to the death rattle


La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie


Credulous at best, your desire to believe in angels in the hearts of men.

Pull your head on out your hippy haze and give a listen.

Shouldn't have to say it all again.

The universe is hostile. so Impersonal. devour to survive.

So it is. So it's always been.


We all feed on tragedy

It's like blood to a vampire


Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies

Much better you than I

Locked up inside you
Like the calm beneath castles
Is a cavern of treasures that
Noone has been to
Let's go digging
Bring it out to take you back in

You won't do what you'd like to do
Lay back and let me show you another way
I'll kill what you want me to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Life's just too short to push it away
Take it all
Take it all in
All the way in
Let it go
Let it go in
You won't feel what you'd like to feel
Lay back and let me show you another way

If you knock me down
I'll just come back running
Knock you down
It won't be long now
All the way in
All the way
Take it up higher
4 degrees warmer
Give in now
And let me in
You'll like this in
Don't pull it out
It brings us closer than
Dying and cancer and crying
Come on
You can take it all
Just like that

Some say the end is near.
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon.
I certainly hope we will.
I sure could use a vacation from this

Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of freaks

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away.
Any fucking time. Any fucking day.
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona Bay.

Fret for your figure and
Fret for your latte and
Fret for your lawsuit and
Fret for your hairpiece and
Fret for your Prozac and
Fret for your pilot and
Fret for your contract and
Fret for your car.

It's a bullshit three ring circus sideshow of freaks

Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away.
Any fucking time. Any fucking day.
Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona Bay.

Some say a comet will fall from the sky.
Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves.
Followed by fault lines that cannot sit still.
Followed by millions of dumbfounded dip shits.

Some say the end is near.
Some say we'll see Armageddon soon.
I certainly hope we will cause
I sure could use a vacation from this

Stupid shit, silly shit, stupid shit...

One great big festering neon distraction,
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied.

Learn to swim. 
[3x]

Mom's gonna fix it all soon.
Mom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be.

Learn to swim.

Fuck L Ron Hubbard and
Fuck all his clones.
Fuck all these gun-toting
Hip gangster wannabes.

Learn to swim.

Fuck retro anything.
Fuck your tattoos.
Fuck all you junkies and
Fuck your short memory.

Learn to swim.

Fuck smiley glad-hands
With hidden agendas.
Fuck these dysfunctional,
Insecure actresses.

Learn to swim.

Cause I'm praying for rain
And I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way.
I wanna watch it all go down.
Mom, please flush it all away.
I wanna see it go right in and down.
I wanna watch it go right in.
Watch you flush it all away.

Time to bring it down again.
Don't just call me pessimist.
Try and read between the lines.

I can't imagine why you wouldn't
Welcome any change, my friend.

I wanna see it all come down.
Bring it down
Suck it down.
Flush it down.

What was it like to see,
The face of your own stability,
Suddenly look away,
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?

Eleven and she was gone.
Eleven is when we waved good-bye.
Eleven is standing still,
Waiting for me to free him,
By coming home.

Moving me with a sound.
Opening me within a gesture.
Drawing me down and in,
Showing me where it all began,
Eleven.

You're too scar'd to realize this,
You are the voice that's been calling me back home.

Under a dead Ohio sky,
Eleven has been and will be waiting,
Defending his light and wondering,
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb I.
So glad that I have found you.
I am but wide awake and heading,
Home.

I wish that I could see you,
Turn and run to play.
Dreams are fading,
Carry my ancient soul.

Carry me into the light.
Aim your body heavenly,
Enduring a memory.
Ill come to your light,
Hold your light.
Hold your light where I can see it,

Hold it,
High.

Hold your light,
Eleven, Lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory,
I'll move,
To heal,
As soon as pain allows so we can,
Reunite,
And both move on together.

Hold,
Your light,
Eleven lead me through each gentle step,
By step,
By inch by loaded memory 'till,
One,
And one are one,
Eleven.
So glow,
Child,
Glow.
I'm heading back home...

[Here is the conversation that takes place between the Nurse and the Doctor, and eventually the Doctor and the Patient.]


Lost Keys 

[voices fading in]


[Nurse:]
 Excuse me? Doctor? Do you have a moment? 


[Doctor:]
 A moment? What's the question? 


[Nurse:]
 More of a situation, a gentleman in exam 3. 


[Doctor:]
 What's the problem? 


[Nurse:]
 That is the problem, we're not sure. 


[Doctor:]
 You got the chart? 


[Nurse:]
 Right here. 


[Doctor:]
 Not much here to say 


[Nurse:]
 No doctor, no obvious physical trauma. Vitals are stable. 


[Doctor:]
 Name?


[Nurse:]
 No sir.


[Doctor:]
 Did someone drop him off?

Maybe we could speak to them.

Let's get some background on this fella.


[Nurse:]
 No ID. Nothing

[heavy breathing in background]

And he won't speak to anybody.


[Doctor:]
 Well, let's say hello.

Good Morning, I'm Dr. Lawson.

How are you today? How - are - you today?!

Look son, you're in a safe place.

We wanna help in whatever way we can.

But you need to talk to us.

We can't help you otherwise.

What's happened? Tell me everything.


[Growling and heavy breathing grows louder]

Choices always were a problem for you.
What you need is someone strong to guide you.
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow,
what you need is someone strong to guide you..
like me, like me, like me, like me

If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me.
Now don't judge or question.
You are broken now, but faith can heal you.
Just do everything I tell you to do.

Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.
What you need is someone strong to guide you.
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.
Let me lay my holy hand upon you.

My Gods will becomes me.
When he speaks out, he speaks through me.
He has needs like I do.
We both want to rape you.


[x2]
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now
Open my eyes and blind me with your light

If you want to get your soul to heaven, trust in me.
Now don't you judge or question.
You are broken now, but faith can heal you.
Just do everything I tell you to do.


[x2]
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life now.
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now.

Alright then, picture this if you will:
10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes, in my &quot;need to know&quot; pose, just outside of Area 51.
Contemplating the whole &quot;chosen people&quot; thing with just a flaming stealth banana split the sky like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this.
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime and stopping right at my Birkenstocks, and me yelping...
Holy fucking shit!

Then the X-Files being, looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan with Isabella Rossellini lips and breath that reeked of vanilla Chig Champa,
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent out of the butt end of the banana vessel and hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw, and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip and all I could think was: &quot;I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice that I pissed my fuckin' pants.&quot;

So light in his way,
Like an apparition,
He had me crying out,
&quot;Fuck me,
It's gotta be,
Deadhead Chemistry,
The blotter got right on top of me,
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T!&quot;

And after calming me down with some orange slices and some fetal spooning, E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose.
He said, &quot;You are the Chosen One, the One who will deliver the message. A message of hope for those who choose to hear it and a warning for those who do not.&quot;
Me. The Chosen One?
They chose me!!!
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school.

You better.
You better.
You better.
You better listen.

Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes.
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down.
This is so real.
Like the time Dave floated away.
See my heart is pounding,
'Cause this shit never happens to me.

Can't breathe, right now!
It was so real.
Like I woke up in Wonderland.
All sort of terrifying.
And I don't wanna be all alone when I tell this story.
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanut's parents
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real.
Finally it's my lucky day.
See my heart is racing,
'Cause this shit never happens to me.

Can't breathe, right now!

You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I just said, see the Dead ain't touring.
And this wasn't all in my head.
See they took me by the hand and invited me right in,
Then they showed me something.
I don't even know where to begin.

Strapped down my bed. Feet cold and eyes red.
I'm out my head. Am I alive, am I dead?
Can't remember what they said.
God damn. Shit the bed!

(high... I I I I I... high... I I I I I)
(high)

[Repeated]

Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position.
Such a heavy burden now to be the one.
Born to bear and read to all
The details of our ending.
To write it down for all the world to see.
But I forgot my pen,
Shit the bed again,
Typical.

Strapped down my bed. Feet cold and eyes red.
I'm out my head. Am I alive, am I dead?
Sunkist and sudafed, gyroscopes and infrared.
Won't help, brain dead.
Can't remember what they said.
God damn. Shit the bed!

I can't remember what they said to me.
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be a hero!
Can't remember what they said.

Bob help me.
Can't remember what they said.

Don't know.
Won't know.

[Repeated]

God damn shit the bed!

A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful.
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on.
Draining patience, drained vitality.
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm still right here.

Wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Be patient (wait it out).

If there were no reward to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through,
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
Gonna wait it out.

If there were no desire to heal
A damaged and broken man along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now.

And I still may ... 
[sigh]
 ... I still may.

Be patient.
I must keep reminding myself of this.

And if there were no rewards to heal,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
And I still may.

Gonna wait it out.

We listen to the tales and romanticize,

how we follow the path of the hero.


Boast about the day when the rivers overrun,

How we'll rise to the height of our halo.


Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,

our way into the arms of the savior.

Feigning all the trials and the tribulations.


None of us have actually been there,

Not like you...


Ignorant siblings in the congregation.

Gather around spewing sympathy,

Spare me...


None of them can even hold a candle up to you.

Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see.


But enough about the collective Judas.

Who could deny you were the one who illuminated?

Your little piece of the divine.


And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me

I'm gonna let it shine

to guide you safely on your way.


Your way home...


Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down?

Without you to guide them all to Zion?

What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun?

Other than tremble incessantly.


High is the way,

but our eyes are upon the ground.

You are the light and the way.

They'll only read about.

I only pray heaven knows,

when to lift you out.


10,000 days in the fire is long enough.

You're going home...


You're the only one who can hold your head up high.

Shake your fist at the gates saying,

&quot;I have come home now...!&quot;

Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father.

Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.


&quot;It's time now!

My time now!

Give me my

Give me my wings...!&quot;


Give me my 
[x5]


(Give me my wings)


You are the light, the way,

that they will only read about.


Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.

Burden of proof tossed upon the believers.

You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,

Judith Marie, unconditional one.


Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.

Difficult to see you in this light.

Please forgive this bold suggestion.

Should you see your maker's face tonight,

Look him in the eye.

Look him in the eye and tell him,

I never lived a lie, never took a life,

But surely saved one.


Hallelujah

It's time for you to bring me home.

Something has to change.
Un-deniable dilemma.
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear.

Constant over stimu-lation numbs me
but I would not want you 
any other way.

It's not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, To feel, to know I'm alive.

Finger deep within the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Relax, turn around and take my hand.

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure.
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way.

Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
Till you will not want me any other way.

It's not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, To feel, to know I'm alive.

Knuckle deep inside the borderline.
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.
Relax. Slip away.

Something kinda sad about
the way that things have come to be.
Desensitized to everything.
What became of subtlety?

How can it mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?

I'll keep digging 
Till I feel something.

Elbow deep inside the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Shoulder deep within the borderline.
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.

&quot;I, I don't have a whole lot of time. 
Um, OK, I'm a former employee of Area 51. 
I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and... 

[chokes]
 I've kind of been running across the country. 
Damn, I don't know where to start, they're, 
they're gonna, um, they'll triangulate on this position really soon.

OK, um, um, OK, 
what we're thinking of as, as aliens, 
they're extradimensional beings, 
that, an earlier precursor of the, um, space program they made contact with. 
They are not what they claim to be. 
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment, 
particularly the Area 51.

The disasters that are coming, they, the military, 
I'm sorry, the government knows about them. 
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving 
the population to now. They are not! 
They want those major population centers wiped out so that the few 
that are left will be more easily controllable.&quot;

My shadow's

Shedding skin and
I've been picking
Scabs again.
I'm down
Digging through
My old muscles
Looking for a clue.

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in.
I wanna feel the changes coming down.
I wanna know what I've been hiding in

My shadow.
Change is coming through my shadow.
My shadow's shedding skin
I've been picking
My scabs again.

I've been crawling on my belly
Clearing out what could've been.
I've been wallowing in my own chaotic
And insecure delusions.

I wanna feel the change consume me,
Feel the outside turning in.
I wanna feel the metamorphosis and
Cleansing I've endured within

My shadow
Change is coming.
Now is my time.
Listen to my muscle memory.
Contemplate what I've been clinging to.
Forty-six and two ahead of me.

I choose to live and to
Grow, take and give and to
Move, learn and love and to
Cry, kill and die and to
Be paranoid and to
Lie, hate and fear and to
Do what it takes to move through.

I choose to live and to
Lie, kill and give and to
Die, learn and love and to
Do what it takes to step through.

See my shadow changing,
Stretching up and over me.
Soften this old armor.
Hoping I can clear the way
By stepping through my shadow,
Coming out the other side.
Step into the shadow.
Forty six and two are just ahead of me.

Suck and suck.
Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck.
Workin up under my patience like a little tick.
Fat little parasite.

Suck me dry.
My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards.
You have turned my blood cold and bitter,
beat my compassion black and blue.

Hope this is what you wanted.
Hope this is what you had in mind.
Cuz this is what you're getting.
I hope you're choking. I hope you choke on this.

Taken all I can, taken you like can, you(?) can take.
Taken all you can, Taken all you can fuckin' take
Got nothing left to give to you.
Blood suckin parasitic little tick/blood suckin parasitic little tick
Take what you want and then go.

Hope this is what you wanted.
Hope this is what you had in mind.
Cuz this is what you're getting.

Suck me dry.
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you had in mind?
Cuz this this is what you're getting.
I hope you choke.

So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now.
Embracing you, this reality here,
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful.
Wide eyed and hopefully wild.

We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion.

Living on the street shores

He didn't learn and wanted children

Said, &quot;What is there left to stay alive for?&quot;

He doesn't wanna see it...


[Maynard:]

He didn't wanna deal with it

Here they come, feelings that come as natural

Whatever left, he considered a loss, y'all

He doesn't wanna see it...


[Maynard:]

Running away, getting some kinda cure

&quot;What is there left to keep him alive?&quot; she said

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him


[Maynard:]

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Don't run away, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love...

FADE

Underneath the skin and jewelry,
hidden in her words and eyes
is a wall that's cold and ugly
and she's scared as hell.
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened
Oh oh oh.

Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened

Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul.
Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul

FADE

Underneath the skin and jewelry,

bottom
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tool/bottom.html

Compassion is broken now
My will is eroded now
Desire is broken now
It makes me feel ugly
I'm on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
So smell my soul is burning
I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy
I have swallowed the poison you feed me
But I survive on the poison you feed me, and it leaves me
Guilt-fed, hatred-fed, weakness-fed
It makes me feel ugly
I'm on my knees and burnin'
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
Dead in... side
Shit adds up, shit adds up
Shit adds up at the bottom


[Henry Rollins:]
If I let you, you would make me destroy myself
In order to survive you, I must first survive myself
And I can sink no further and I cannot forgive you
There's no choice but to confront you
To engage you
To erase you
I've gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain
I will use my mistakes against you
There's no other choice
Shameless now, nameless now, nothing now, no one now
And my soul must be iron
Cause my fear is naked
I'm naked and fearless
And my fear is naked

Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside
Nameless now, shameless now
Nothing now, no one now

Shit adds up, shit adds up
Shit adds up, as you see me
Naked now, fearless now
Naked now, fearless now

Shit adds... shit adds...
Shit adds... shit adds up it leaves me
Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside

Hatred keeps me alive
Hungriness keeps me alive
Weakness keeps me alive
Guilt keeps me alive at the bottom

flood
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tool/flood.html

Here comes the water

All I knew and all I believed
Are crumbling images
That no longer comfort me
I scramble to reach higher ground
Some order and sanity
Or something to comfort me

So I take what is mine,and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be

Thought I was high
Thought I was free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny

I was wrong
This changes everything

The water is rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead

The ground is breaking down right under me
Cleanse and purge me
In the water
[end]
