And to love: a god
And to fear: a flame
And to burn a crowd that has a name
And to right or wrong
And to meek or strong
It is known; just scream it from the wall

I've willed, I've walked, I've read
I've talked, I know, I know,
I've been here before, yeah

Now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that...

It's the sun that burns
It's the wheel that turns
It's the way we sing that makes 'em dream
And to Christ: a cross
And to me: a chair
I will sit and earn the ransom from up here

I've willed, I've walked, I've read
I've talked, I know, I know,
I've been here before, yeah

Now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that...
Scarred like that...

And to love: a god
And to fear: a flame
And to burn: a love that has a name

I've willed, I've walked, I've read
I've talked, I know, I know,
I've been here before, yeah

Now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that...
Hey, hey, now, now, now...
We won't be scarred like that...
We won't be scarred like that...

it's easier not to be wise

and measure these things by your brains

I sank into Eden with you

alone in the church by and by

I'll read to you here, save your eyes

you'll need them, your boat is at sea

your anchor is up, you've been swept away

and the greatest of teachers won't hesitate

to leave you there, by yourself, chained to fate


I alone love you

I alone tempt you

I alone love you

fear is not the end of this!


it's easier not to be great

and measure these things by your eyes

we long to be here by his resolve

alone in the church by and by

to cradle the baby in space

and leave you there by yourself chained to fate


oh, now, we took it back too far,

only love can save us now,

all these riddles that you burn

all come runnin' back to you,

all these rhythms that you hide

only love can save us now,

all these riddles that you burn yeah, yeah, yeah

thedolphinscry
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/live/thedolphinscry.html

The way you're bathed in light

reminds me of that night

god laid me down into your rose garden of trust

and I was swept away

with nothin' left to say

some helpless fool

yeah I was lost in a swoon of peace

you're all I need to find

so when the time is right

come to me sweetly, come to me

come to me


love will lead us, alright

love will lead us, she will lead us

can you hear the dolphin's cry?

see the road rise up to meet us

it's in the air we breathe tonight

love will lead us, she will lead us


oh yeah, we meet again

it's like we never left

time in between was just a dream

did we leave this place?

this crazy fog surrounds me

you wrap your legs around me

all I can do to try and breathe

let me breathe so that I

so we can go together!


love will lead us, alright

love will lead us, she will lead us

can you hear the dolphin's cry?

see the road rise up to meet us

it's in the air we breathe tonight

love will lead us, she will lead us


life is like a shooting star

it don't matter who you are

if you only run for cover, it's just a waste of time

we are lost 'til we are found

this phoenix rises up from the ground

and all these wars are over


over

over

singin' la da da, da da da

over

come to me

singin' la da da da, da da da

come to me

I wanna feel

I wanna try

I wanna rock in the city tonight

I wanna deal

don't wanna die

I wanna bring my captain hook into the light


people I've seen my day

ranting and raving this beauty away

we are by and large the same

but words are too feeble, they cannot contain


he was a &quot;rock and roll messiah&quot;

she was known for her childcare

the truth is gonna give up the world

if you can give up the stage

if I can give up the stage

if we can give up the stage


come to this,

I can't come to you don't do this,

wake me up tonight

come to this,

I can't come to you don't do this,

wake me up tonight

when all that's left to do is

reflect on what's been done

this is where sadness breaths

the sadness of everyone


just like when the guys

built the dam at otter creek

and all the water backed up

deep enough to dive


we took the dead man in sheets to the river

flanked by love

deep enough to dive

deep enough to dive

be here now


we took him there and three

in a stretcher made from trees

that had passed in the storm

leave the hearse behind

to leave the curse be here now

lightning crashes, a new mother cries
her placenta falls to the floor
the angel opens her eyes
the confusion sets in
before the doctor can even close the door

lightning crashes, an old mother dies
her intentions fall to the floor
the angel closes her eyes
the confusion that was hers
belongs now to the baby down the hall

oh now feel it comin' back again
like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it.

lightning crashes, a new mother cries
this moment she's been waiting for
the angel opens her eyes
pale blue colored iris,
presents the circle
and puts the glory out to hide, hide

oh now feel it comin' back again
like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it. I can feel it.

Oh why 
[3x]

I can feel it comin' back again
like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it.

I can feel it comin' back again
like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
forces pullin' from the center of the earth again
I can feel it.

I can feel it comin' back again
like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
forces pullin' from the center of the earth again

I can feel it 
[3x]

In the country 

The farms and the orchards swell 

With oranges and peaches 

A little bit of truth as well 


In the city 

Politicians beat their drum 

All the suits come a runnin' 

It's all degeneration 


Life Marches On 

Life Marches On 

Life Marches On 


In the country 

Everybody thinks we're dumb 

But we built the fire 

Why'd you come and get you some? 


In the city, skyscrapers touch the sky 

What's the use in being so high up 

When it's only gonna bleed you dry? 


Life Marches On 

Life Marches On 

Life Marches On 


In the country 

The stars shine brighter 

Than in the city 

In the country 

In the country 


In the city 

I turn on the radio 

Only leaves me down with the question: 

What happened to our generation? 


Life Marches On 

Life Marches On 

Life Marches On 

Oh yeah, yeah 

Life Marches On 

Oh yeah 

Life Marches On 

Life Marches On 

Life Marches On

Darling, I feel like a god when I am next to you 

Something sacred, someone straight and true 

Tell me, do you feel the same way too?

The kind that's sent straight down from up above 

And now you're all I'm thinking of

Thinking of 

Thinking of 


Don't you give me loving like a revelation 

Don't you make me burn and make me feel the danger 

Salutations to the maker of my finest hour 

Goddess, queen, mother, sister, lover 

Don't you ever leave
