The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could this be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)

In my head we're already together
I'm good alone but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)

Should I tell her how I really feel (how I really feel)
Or should I move in close or just be still? (how will I know?)
'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know if she feels the same?

Could it be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby, now it's time for us
Tryna to keep it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
(doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings (doo-do-doo-doo-do-do-do-do-do-do-doo)
Catching feelings....

This is the time of year we can give it,
Give it, give it, give it all
One through ten on your list you can get it,
Get it, get it, get it now
Make your wish tonight
When you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl
I'll be right there

Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, ohhh
Wanna put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
(Fa la la la la, fa la la la la)
I know that it's christmas time

You got on my favourite dress
You're looking, looking, looking good
Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't
Wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
Wanna be your biggest gift

Baby you deserved everything you want
It's your night, ohhh
Wanna put my ear to your chest now
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
(Fa la la la la, fa la la la la)
I know that it's christmas time

I'll deck your heart with bells of holly (bells of holly)
Fa la la la la la la, fa la la la la la la...
Baby cause you're the reason to be, jolly
Fa la la la la la la, la la la la la la la...

I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
(Fa la la la la, fa la la la la)
I know that it's christmas time

Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Like christmas
I know that it's christmas time
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la

Know that it's christmas time...

oldschoolflow
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/justinbieber/oldschoolflow.html

Let me start off with the old school flow 
[x2]
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits I got number one flicks and the number one kicks and number one chicks 
Fast like Gordan and my jams like Jordan and my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboard in and my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune? 
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this 
People in their basements say that I didn't write this 
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this 
Checks like Nike let me give you a good night kiss 
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering like picking on a little kid like taking all his licorice 
I hate it when they littering I hate to be illiterate 
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha and Imma go right threw ya and I'm so much cooler and I don't need Luda to know that I'm the ruler and 
I'm so much cooler you should call me Ferris Bueller.

choosin

Yeah yeah...

Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
All eyes on me when I walk through
Choosin
Waiting near
Choosin
On me
Choosin
All eyes on me when I walk through

Desperation, human nature
Seen you watching
We've been undressing each other
And I don't mind (choosin)
So I don't mind (choosin)
Gotta speak my mind (choosin)
Choose up one time
All eyes on me when I walk through

Choos-choosin...

How can I help if you're good at not keeping her attention
She walked and she been in a mission
After nothing but damn right intentions (somebody)
I ain't see nothing but diamonds
They talking, she listening
Screaming and laugh from a distance
Don't be shy does she coming or missing
Don't doubt it

Be wise by who you calling your own
'Cause you might be left alone, that's right
This star's so bright, she can not put too far though
She get it back tomorrow

Now she's
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
Choosin
Say you're choosin babe
All eyes on me when I walk through
Choosin
Waiting near
Choosin
On me
Choosin
All eyes on me when I walk through

Desperation, human nature
Seen you watching
We've been undressing each other
And I don't mind (choosin)
So I don't mind (choosin)
Gotta speak my mind (choosin)
Choose up one time
All eyes on me when I walk through

Choos-choosin

When I look in your eyes
I can tell that you wanna be (tell that you wanna be)
'Cause she's making the way so she can be right in front of me (be right in front of me)
Don't pretend in the end you gave your number to my friend
So don't you bring your friends come to the topfloor to the penthouse girl

Desperation, human nature
Seen you watching
We've been undressing each other
And I don't mind (choosin)
So I don't mind (choosin)
Gotta speak my mind (choosin)
Choose up one time
All eyes on me when I walk through

Choos-choosin...

playtime

JB... Khalil...


[Hook - Justin Bieber:]
Playtime is over, over (say what)
I got no time to play no games with you
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you


[Verse 1 - Justin Bieber:]
No more playing games
No more arguing, asking me where I'm gonna be
Such a waste of time
There's no need to fight (there's no need to fight)
I want to spend that time laughing out loud
Cause there ain't really no time for arguing no


[Khalil &amp; Justin Bieber:]
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you
I got no time to play no games with you
Playtime is over, over (over)
I got no time to play no games with you


[Bridge - Khalil &amp; Justin Bieber:]
I don't want to move on
So don't push me away, to get to my heart
Don't play no games (don't play no games)
I got no time to play no games with you


[Verse 2 - Khalil:]
I won't say no names, I won't say no names
But you're playing games
See lately, baby girl it just ain't been the same (oh no)
Just saying what's on my mind, I hope you feel my pain
Well girl I guess it's just a part of love
But I hope you know that you're the one I'm dreaming of


[Hook - Justin Bieber:]
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you
Playtime is over, over
I got no time to play no games with you


[Bridge - Justin Bieber:]
Hard to move on
So don't push me away to get to my heart
Don't play no games
Playtime is over, over (over)
I got no time to play no games with you (games with you)
