Awake, to the sound of emptiness
Alone in a room that's filled with the darkest of light
I was told there was nothing beyond here
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
How do I know what side I'm on
Bred a captive with nothing but their thoughts engraved in my skin
I don't belong here, but I can't find my exit

This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down
Where they come to hunt me down, they hunt me down

Weigh out the options
Brave the new world
I know what you're thinking
Come on man, I swear you can do this
Come on man, I swear you can do this

I break free from this room they built for me
I break free from this room they built for me

This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down
Where they come to hunt me down, they hunt me down

I tore out my naive eyes, so they locked me up
I tore out my naive eyes, so they locked me up

Preying on the innocent
Preying on the innocent

criesofthepast
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/underoath/criesofthepast.html

It happened all so fast, heavy with sleep, my eyes closed...
The next thing I remember was crawling out from the car,
And seeing you lying there
Holding your head, kissing you for the last time
The taste of blood on my lips...
Your clothes torn apart, perfumed with gas
It seems like it was yesterday when the rain poured down
I can still hear your screams as if it was happening all over again

Saturday, December 4th:
That night would become a grave,
That would crush my heart
Joy and laughter exchanged for grief, and silence.
Searching for so long to find you,
And the moment I did, you were ripped from me...
Laying here on this empty shelf never to be read again
In these pages lies every memory of you
The wind blew your heart over my eyes,
And I slept for days praying not to awake,
But these dreams can only last so long.
Facing the day looking through these tears
I'll always look back and remember that night...
(... ? ...)

Looking over that casket, seeing your face..
Times of past rushing by..
Touching your cold hand, wishing it would touch me back
You look so pretty lying there, just like the first day we met

It feels so real; like old times, but it's nothing, it's nothing...

I can taste the stale air on my tongue.
And death lights up the sky.
Hope finds itself it and it ends, stopping at my thoughts
Pictures of you help bring back the tears

Walking in the present, but living in the past
How much longer will I embrace sorrow?

From the moment that you entered my life
My whole outlook on love would change

You brought out a happiness I didn't even know I had,
And now you've gone, leaving without a goodbye...

THAT GLASS HEART THAT RESTED IN MY CHEST HAS FALLEN AND SHATTERED

Here on, Lord, is the remains of a broken heart
For I have faith you can give me joy and life again

Death has fallen, but love covers me
Heaven is now home to my angel of love

Good God, if your song leaves our lips
If your work leaves our hands
Then we will be wonders and vagabonds
They will stare and say how empty we are
How the freedom we had turned us up as dead men
Let us be cold, make us weak
Let us, because we all have ears
Let us, because we all have eyes
How they knew that this would happen
We're so run down
Good God! Can you still get us home...
How can we still get home
I'm not dreaming
We're forgetting our forgiveness

walkingaway
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/underoath/walkingaway.html

The day I left you was the worst mistake I ever made. 
[x4]
THE DAY... I LEFT.. YOU.. WAS THE WORST... MISTAKE.. I EVER MADE..
Was ready to become something, I didn't need you dragging me down
I thought love just wasn't enough
My hair combed, nice shoes tied tight
Was ready to conquer life
Help unwanted, I can do this on my own...
And then I found myself wounded,
Tripping over myself, falling, scraping my knee...
Sadness fills, for I know I've failed
Why did I leave scared to go back?
Hoping you'll take me in with open arms
But also know that the hurt I've caused...
The breeze of angel's wings,
Standing there in a midst of flowers of every being
Tears grow and an orchestra begins to play
What a beautiful day, why are you alone?
Run child, it's time for you to go home...
Wounded spirit face in the dirt
I cry out for you to take me in
Your heart holds me close,
And I look up to face this world which so scares me
Faith in you.. loneliness just seems to fade.
The man once inside, now a child walking in your footsteps..
Hoping to grow up to be just like you Jesus 
[x2]
Hoping held leaves under feet from the trees of fall
Listening to autumn's call
A deeper breathe to continue on.
Fragile.
Depending on you, Christ carries me the rest of the walk... 
[x2]

You said there was nothing left down here
Well I roamed around the wasteland
And I swear I found something
I found hope, I found God
I found the dreams of the believers

Oh, God! Save us all

(It's too late)
(It's too late, now, to pry away)
(To pry away)
My candle burns on both ends so where does it leave us
Standing emptier than we ever left you
With your head in the water it's getting harder to breathe
So stand up, stand up

It's too late, to pry away
It's too late, to pry away

Don't get me wrong, I'm just as scared as you are now
You dropped us off here with no direction
But you never even tried to fight the current
Watch the water pouring faster into your lungs
So breathe in, breathe in

It's too late, to pry away
It's too late, to pry away

But it's hard to hear me when your sinking, down, here
I wanna see you wash it down, wash it down
How can you sleep here
I bear the weight of your world
I don't believe in a single word you sold to me, sold to me
I bear your burden for the last time
I swear I'm done with all of this

It's too late, to pry away from the undertow
I watch it take you, then I walk away
[end]
