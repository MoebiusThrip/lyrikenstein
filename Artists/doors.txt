Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road, yeah

Girl, you gotta love your man
Girl, you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends
Our life will never end
Gotta love your man, yeah

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan.
Riders on the storm

Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm

Man, the first woman know she smells so nice
And she looks so good I gotta zip up once or twice
Well I've been down
Up and up
Up and down
In 99, but I love my woman
Like the sun goes up

She's the sweetest little woman
When she wakes up
Come on, now right

Now you walk around
And you thinking that you're so tough
I see you walking around
You think that you're so though
Well you got some thing momma,
But it's not enough

I'm going home
I'm going home and lay down
I'm going home, baby
I'm going home and lay down

Gonna switch on the television
I'm gonna drown, yeah

Well it's a long time coming
Long time coming, long time coming
Long time coming, long time coming
But when you find her baby
You know you found something good

When you find somebody now,
Don't leave it no good.

Carry me Caravan take me away 

Take me to Portugal, take me to Spain 

Andalusia with fields full of grain 

I have to see you again and again 

Take me, Spanish Caravan 

Yes, I know you can 


Trade winds find Galleons lost in the sea 

I know where treasure is waiting for me 

Silver and gold in the mountains of Spain 

I have to see you again and again

This is the end 

Beautiful friend 

This is the end 

My only friend, the end 


Of our elaborate plans, the end 

Of everything that stands, the end 

No safety or surprise, the end 

I'll never look into your eyes...again 


Can you picture what will be 

So limitless and free 

Desperately in need...of some...stranger's hand 

In a...desperate land 


Lost in a Roman...wilderness of pain 

And all the children are insane 

All the children are insane 

Waiting for the summer rain, yeah 


There's danger on the edge of town 

Ride the King's highway, baby 

Weird scenes inside the gold mine 

Ride the highway west, baby 


Ride the snake, ride the snake 

To the lake, the ancient lake, baby 

The snake is long, seven miles 

Ride the snake...he's old, and his skin is cold 


The west is the best 

The west is the best 

Get here, and we'll do the rest 


The blue bus is callin' us 

The blue bus is callin' us 

Driver, where you taken' us 


The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on 

He took a face from the ancient gallery 

And he walked on down the hall 

He went into the room where his sister lived, and...then he 

Paid a visit to his brother, and then he 

He walked on down the hall, and 

And he came to a door...and he looked inside 

Father, yes son, I want to kill you 

Mother...I want to...fuck you 


C'mon baby, take a chance with us 

C'mon baby, take a chance with us 

C'mon baby, take a chance with us 

And meet me at the back of the blue bus 

Doin' a blue rock 

On a blue bus 

Doin' a blue rock 

C'mon, yeah 


Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill 


This is the end 

Beautiful friend 

This is the end 

My only friend, the end 


It hurts to set you free 

But you'll never follow me 

The end of laughter and soft lies 

The end of nights we tried to die 


This is the end

She lives on Love Street 

Lingers long on Love Street 

She has a house and garden 

I would like to see what happens 


She has robes and she has monkeys 

Lazy diamond studded flunkies 

She has wisdom and knows what to do 

She has me and she has you 


She has wisdom and knows what to do 

She has me and she has you 


I see you live on Love Street 

There's this store where the creatures meet 

I wonder what they do in there 

Summer Sunday and a year 

I guess I like it fine, so far 


She lives on Love Street 

Lingers long on Love Street 

She has a house and garden 

I would like to see what happens

When I was back there in seminary school 

There was a person there 

Who put forth the proposition 

That you can petition the Lord with prayer 

Petition the lord with prayer 

Petition the lord with prayer 

You cannot petition the lord with prayer! 


Can you give me sanctuary 

I must find a place to hide 

A place for me to hide 


Can you find me soft asylum 

I can't make it anymore 

The Man is at the door 


Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy 

Champion sax and a girl named Sandy 

There's only four ways to get unraveled 

One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da 

One is a bandit up in the hills 

One is to love your neighbor 'till 

His wife gets home 


Catacombs 

Nursery bones 

Winter women 

Growing stones 

Carrying babies 

To the river 


Streets and shoes 

Avenues 

Leather riders 

Selling news 

The monk bought lunch 


Ha ha, he bought a little 

Yes, he did 

Woo! 

This is the best part of the trip 

This is the trip, the best part 

I really like 

What'd he say? 

Yeah! 

Yeah, right! 

Pretty good, huh 

Huh! 

Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number 


Successful hills are here to stay 

Everything must be this way 

Gentle streets where people play 

Welcome to the Soft Parade 


All our lives we sweat and save 

Building for a shallow grave 

Must be something else we say 

Somehow to defend this place 

Everything must be this way 

Everything must be this way, yeah 


The Soft Parade has now begun 

Listen to the engines hum 

People out to have some fun 

A cobra on my left 

Leopard on my right, yeah 


The deer woman in a silk dress 

Girls with beads around their necks 

Kiss the hunter of the green vest 

Who has wrestled before 

With lions in the night 


Out of sight! 

The lights are getting brighter 

The radio is moaning 

Calling to the dogs 

There are still a few animals 

Left out in the yard 

But it's getting harder 

To describe sailors 

To the underfed 


Tropic corridor 

Tropic treasure 

What got us this far 

To this mild equator? 


We need someone or something new 

Something else to get us through, yeah, c'mon 


Callin' on the dogs 

Callin' on the dogs 

Oh, it's gettin' harder 

Callin' on the dogs 

Callin' in the dogs 

Callin' all the dogs 

Callin' on the gods 


You gotta meet me 

Too late, baby 

Slay a few animals 

At the crossroads 

Too late 

All in the yard 

But it's gettin' harder 

By the crossroads 

You gotta meet me 

Oh, we're goin', we're goin great 

At the edge of town 

Tropic corridor 

Tropic treasure 

Havin' a good time 

Got to come along 

What got us this far 

To this mild equator? 

Outskirts of the city 

You and I 

We need someone new 

Somethin' new 

Somethin' else to get us through 

Better bring your gun 

Better bring your gun 

Tropic corridor 

Tropic treasure 

We're gonna ride and have some fun 


When all else fails 

We can whip the horse's eyes 

And make them sleep 

And cry

One, two, three, four billion souls are gonna rest
If all our friends don't try their best
To change the way this world is headed for
We can find our hapiness
It aint so hard to find
Just look a little further up the line
Just a little further up in time
Don't you see that we could be the first in history
Leavin' all that we don't need behind
We could clean it up and make it shine

Time to live 

Time to lie 

Time to laugh 

Time to die 


Takes it easy, baby 

Take it as it comes 

Don't move too fast 

And you want your love to last 

Oh, you've been movin' much too fast 


Time to walk 

Time to run 

Time to aim your arrows 

At the sun 


Takes it easy, baby 

Take it as it comes 

Don't move too fast 

And you want your love to last 

Oh, you've been movin' much too fast 


Go real slow 

You like it more and more 

Take it as it comes 

Specialize in havin' fun 


Takes it easy, baby 

Take it as it comes 

Don't move too fast 

And you want your love to last 

Oh, you've been movin' much too fast 

Movin' much too fast 

Movin' much too fast
