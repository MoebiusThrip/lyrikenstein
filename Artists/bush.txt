There must be something we can eat
Maybe find another lover
Should I fly to Los Angeles
Find my asshole brother

Mickey mouse has grown up a cow
Dave's on sale again
We kissy kiss in the rear view
We're so bored
You're to blame

Try to see it once my way
Everything Zen
Everything Zen
I don't think so

Rain dogs howl for the century
A million dollars at stake
As you search for your demi-god
And you fake with a saint
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
Try to see it once my way
Everything Zen
Everything Zen
I don't think so

I don't believe that Elvis is dead
I don't believe that Elvis is dead
I don't believe that Elvis is, Elvis is

There's no sex in your violence

comedown

love and hate get it wrong
she cut me right back down to size
sleep the day let it fade
who was there to take your place
no one knows never will
mostly me but mostly you
what do you say do you do
when it all comes down

cause I don't want to come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this time to find out what I need yeah
I don't want to come back down from this cloud
taken me all this time to find out what I need

there's no blame only shame
when you beg you just complain
the more I come the more I try
all police are paranoid
so am I so's the future
so are you be a creature
what do you say do you do when it all comes down


[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this time to find out what I need (yea, yea, yea)
'Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this (all this)time

Shoot up
Shoot up
Shoot up
You're high

Love and hate get it wrong
she cut me right down to size
sleep the day, let it fade
who was there to take your place
no one knows never will
mostly me but mostly you
what do you say so you do when it all comes down


[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this time to find out what I need (yea, yea, yea)
'Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
it's taken me all this (all this)time

Why did you
why did you
why did you
why did you
why did you
why did you
why did you
why did you
why did you come down
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud (this cloud, this cloud, this cloud this, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud, this cloud)

Hell bent useless void
Feed your favorite paranoid
Wash these hands for a change
One step closer by the way

Spin around
All the way
Nothing left
Give it all away
Give it all away

Sell me up the jacket straits eat the worlds 
Left on my plate summer's shot and so I'm smoked all day
Doctor ain't it good to live

Spin around
All the way
Nothing left
Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away

Everyday give yourself away
Coming undone in that usual way
Usual way

She's been around
Our way
Not that well
Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away
All my way

swim
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bush/swim.html

could not believe
came here today
helmet was on
you blew me away
house is on fire 
we're naked again
maybe all we need 
is water and friends

shackles and chains
won't keep me away
temple is you
and my brow is insane

I wanna be just like you
I wanna feel right through you 
I wanna see just with you
I wanna live
I wanna die you

thinning ice
14 hairdryers
swimming to you 
flame on earth desire
poor on the rise
rich on the fall
this cripple's with you 
fame is a whore

I wanna fit inside you 
I wanna room inside you 
if money talks I wanna buy you 
I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna live you

I'm not scared of you
gave up on drugs
if I make it through
the jaws of love
jaws of love

you give

littlethings
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bush/littlethings.html

I bleach the sky
every night
loaded on wrong
and further from right
spinning around
two howling moons 
cos there always there
whatever I do

the river is loaded
I've been there today
tool it some questions
she does me again
I'd die in your arms 
if you were dead too
here comes a lie
we will always be true

going up
when coming down
scratch away
it's the little things that kill
tearing at my brains again
the little things that kill
the little things that kill

bigger you give
bigger you get
we're boss at denia
l but our best at forget
cupboard is empty
we really need food
summer is winter
and you always knew

going up when coming down
scratch away

I touch you mouth 
my willy is food
addicted to love
I'm addicted to you shit
I kill you once
I kill you again
we're starving and crude
welcome my friends to

the little things that kill
[end]
bomb
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bush/bomb.html

wanted to buy you shiny red things
thought I'd be with you until the end
how did I know that I would be there
blow me away
see if I care

death of a future
goodbye to my friends
wish I could see you all again
family hollow
family real
wish you were here see how I feel

kill a man
kill a girl
kill a man
kill a girl

jekyll in you
brins out the wired in me
I have no defense
I'm all that you see
the night is a bomb blast
the night is on fire
sing with me in the gasoline choir

and you say you want to change our minds
I've paid for your belief with mine
of all the bravest stands in ti;me

you stoop so low you'll never rise
[end]
theonlywayout
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bush/theonlywayout.html

Follow me down to the water
Through the trip wires in your head
Through the seven layers
Of your holy bed

Where there is no one God
But a series of systems
I wanna be your savior
I wanna be your seasons

The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you
The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you

Follow me down to the freeway
Where the beat goes on
And a heatwave blast the night

Say what you will but we pray
To the God's of our own demise
All the time

The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you
The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you

Let's build a bonfire tonight
We'll stay warm in the night time
Warm in the night time

Follow me down to the water
Through the trip wires in your head
Through the seven layers
Of your holy bed

Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh

The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you
The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you

The only way out
The only way out
The only way out is through
Lost my mind over you
[end]
