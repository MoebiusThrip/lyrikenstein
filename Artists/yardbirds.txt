heartfullofsoul
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yardbirds/heartfullofsoul.html

Sick at heart and lonely,
Deep in dark despair.
Thinking one thought only
Where is she tell me where.
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know if she had me back again
Well I would never make her sad.
I've gotta heart full of soul.

She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea.
[end]
evilheartedyou
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/yardbirds/evilheartedyou.html

Evil hearted you.
You always try to put me down,
With the things you do,
And words,
You spread around against me.

Evil hearted you.
You kept,
Kidding me along,
With your phoney smile,
And with,
Your siren song smiling, beguiling,
You lead me on 'til all hope's gone,
Persuading, degrading,
On my knees I try to please.

But I love you,
Just the same,
And I want you,
To remain,
By my side,
And you'll see,
Just how much you,
Mean to me.

Evil hearted you.
You always try to put me down,
With the things you do,
And words,
You spread around against me,
About me.
What would you,
Do without me?
Smiling, beguiling,
You lead me on 'til all hope has gone.

You say hop and I'll hop,
You say stop and I'll stop,
You say come and I come,
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

With one wave of your hand,
I'm your slave to command,
But I'm glad it's OK,
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

You can stretch me until I'm ten feet tall,
Or cut me down to the size of a rubber ball.
You can use me, abuse me, but never remove me,
Without your love I ain't nothing at all.
Oh well ah.

They say I'm a fool,
'Cos you treat me so cruel,
But I'll go on this way.
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Oh ah-ah.

You can stretch me until I'm ten feet tall,
or cut me down to the size of a rubber ball.
You can use me, abuse me, but never refuse me,
Without your love I ain't nothing at all.
Oh well ah.

They say I'm a fool,
'Cos you treat me so cruel,
But I'll go on this way,
Oh anything you say I'm like a hunk of clay.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

I'm just like putty,
Putty in your hands ah-ah,
Well ah-ah.

Can you judge a man by the way he wears his hair?
Can you read his mind by the clothes that he wears?
Can you see a bad man by the pattern on his tie?

Well thenMisterMr, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mister, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I

Could you tell a wise man by the way he speaks or spells?
Is this more important than the stories that he tells?
And call a man a fool if for wealth he doesn't strive?

Well then, Mister, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mister, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I

Can you condemn a man if your faith he doesn't hold?
Say the colour of his skin is the colour of his soul?
Could you say that men for king and country all must die?

Well, Mister, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I
Oh, Mister, you're a better man than I
Yeah, Mister, you're a better man than I

There's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time.
(What's her name?) I can't tell you. (No!)
I can't reveal her name until I've got her.
(What's her name?) I can't tell you. (No!)
Well, I've tried to get her time and time again.
We just end up as nothing but friends.
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time.
(What's her name?) I can't tell you. (No!)
Well, there's a certain chick I've been sweet on since I met her.
(What's her name?) I can't tell you. (No!)
I can't repeat her name until I get her.
(What's her name?) I can't tell you. (No!)
Well one day, I'm gonna wake up and say,
&quot;I'll do anything just to be your slave.&quot;
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time.
(What's her name?) I can't tell you. (No!)

Ain't but one way out
Lord, I ain't goin' out that door
Ain't but one way out
Lord, I ain't goin' out that door
There's a man down there
May be your man, I won't know

Lord you got me trapped woman
Up on the second floor
If I get by this time
I won't be trapped no more
So raise our window baby
I can ease out soft and slow
And lord, your neighbors
Won't be talking stuff they don't know

Lord, I'm foolish to be here in the first place
I know some man gonna walk in and take my place
Ain't no way in the world
I'm going out that front door
Cause there's a man down there
Might be your man I don't know
Cause there's a man down there
Might be your man I don't know

Feet on the sidewalk
I feel kinda sick
Hands out front
I need a white stick
Blurred in the morning
Bruised at night
Falling in the darkness
Could've been a fight

My blind life
I cant see the road
I cant see the light

Kicking in the doorway
Climbing up the stairs
wading in the water
Knocking on the door
Bringing home the Bacon
Back to the wall
Feel like a looser
Gonna take a fall

My blind life
I cant see the road
I cant see the light

My blind life
I cant see the road
I cant see the light

I'm gon' get up in the mornin', I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gon' get up in the mornin', I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man you been lovin', girlfriend, can't get my room

I'm gon' write a letter, telephone every town I know
I'm gon' write a letter, telephone every town I know
If I can't find her in West Helena, she must be in East Monroe I know

I don't want no woman, wants every downtown man she meet
I don't want no woman, wants every downtown man she meet
She's a no good doney, they shouldn't 'low her on the street

I believe, I believe I'll go back home
I believe, I believe I'll go back home
You can mistreat me here, babe, but you can't when I go home

And I'm gettin' up in the mornin', I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gettin' up in the mornin', I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man you been lovin', girlfriend, can't get my room

I'm 'on' call up Chiney, see is my good gal over there
I'm 'on' call up Chiney, see is my good gal over there
If I can't find her on Philippine's Island, she must be in Ethiopia somewhere
