[Snoop Dogg:]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey


[Katy:]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
(West Coast)
Now put your hands up


[Snoop Dogg:]
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild Wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach
I'm okay
I won't play
I love the bait
Just like I love LA
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys
Bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis
Martinis, no weenies
Just the King and the Queeny
Katy, my lady (yeah)
Lookie here, baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you're representin' California (oh yeah)


[Katy:]
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle

California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock

(West Coast, West Coast)
Now put your hands up


[Snoop Dogg:]
(California, California girls)

When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before
When there's nothing left left to say
I'll say it all again, but until then...

And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, cause I do, Jesus

No music to play so I sing you my own song
Come on and sing along
When there's nothing that remains
You still stay the same
You're looking so strong

And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, cause I do

And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say I love you
And I'll give you my heart, say I love you
Oh, cause I do, sweet Jesus

When there's nothing left to give
I will give you more than I ever gave before

I'm gonna give you my heart
I'm gonna give you my heart

naturally
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katyperry/naturally.html

Did it seem
To disappoint you
Living alone?
By the banks
Of your dilemma
Out of control
No one seems
To give the answers
That you wanna hear
What you'd give
To find a welcome here

Miles and miles of lies
Behind you
Those were the days
So many lives
You'd hope would guide you
Help you find a way
Now it seems to your surprise
That they left you lying here
What you'd give to dry
These bitter tears

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

Heaven waits
The hours of silence
Finds you on your knees
Broken in a sweet surrender
Of peace
All the years of searching
for a love you didn't know
Now you've finally found
A welcome home

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

I love you, I have
And I always will.

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say

Did it come naturally?
You a million miles from home
When you tried so carefully
To live a life
That's not your own
Always remember
That it wasn't that long ago
I stilled the oceans
I moved the mountains
To say I love you

electricfeel
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katyperry/electricfeel.html

All along the western front 
People line up to receive. 
She got the power in her hand 
To shock you like you won't believe. 
Saw her in the amazon 
With the voltage running through her skin 
Standing there with nothing on 
She gonna teach me how to swim 

I said ooh girl 
Shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl 
Turn me on with your electric feel 

I said ooh girl 
Shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl 
Turn me on with your electric feel 

All along the eastern shore 
Put your circuits in the sea 
This is what the world is for 
Making electricity 
You can feel it in your mind 
Oh you can do it all the time 
Plug it in and change the world 
You are my electric girl. 

I said ooh girl 
Shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl 
Turn me on with your electric feel 

I said ooh girl 
Shock me like an electric eel 
Baby girl 
Turn me on with your electric feel 

Do what you feel now 
Electric feel now 
Do what you feel now 
Electric feel now 
Do what you feel now 
Electric feel now 
Do what you feel now 
Electric feel now 
Do what you feel now 
Electric feel now

You could throw me
In the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith
Is Your desire
And Your love endures

You could throw me
In the prison cell
Shackle me up
Against the rail
But time
And time again
My faith won't fail

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

You could cast me
In the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace
Surrounds me
And it sets me free

And I can walk
Upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are
Set upon You
And no one
Can bring me down

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

For His angels
Surround me
And You've poured out
This blood covering
And I will walk
And not fail
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time
And time again
My faith won't fail

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again

For He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My trials
And tribulations
And He'll prevail
In the midst of all
My sin
And temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall
And He
Will pick me up
For time
And time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail

We're all chained to the rhythm

Are we crazy?
Living our life through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm

Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

[Skip Marley:]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

[Verse 1]
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are,
But you better choose carefully
Cause I-I-I-I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your ONE &amp; ONLY
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy
Your enemy


[Hook]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a DARK HORSE
Are you ready for? ready for?
A perfect storm? perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back!! hey! Hey! Hey!


[Verse 2]
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're DOWN TO EARTH,
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away.
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or a no?
No maybe, so just be sure
Before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me


[Hook]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?

I'm an outcast, I got THAT!
So the player list the Cadillac music,
and that's just a start
MY LIFE, I took it from the back to the front, Rosa park
Who cares what they blink or they bought
Who cares what they think or they thought
Baby, we can do it in the car
In the kitchen, on the floor
In the middle of the park - I'm here to play
With a little ding
I pump blood through your veins, your heart
And all these packs of lil players acting like they can hate
But they can not, 
CAN'T WON'T DON'T NEVER
WILL YOU KEEP REAL?
ONE, TWO, THREE
FOUR TIMES,
CYPRESS HILL
Hey Ms. Perry,
Looking fine with your fine self
Want a little bit of magic?
I'm Maverick top gun
If you lookin' and you look no further, you got one!
He! I got 'em confused
Is he Hispanic? or is he Caucasian?!
No worry about where I'm from, 
Just know one thing: I'M AMAZING!


[Hook]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a DARK HORSE
Are you ready for? ready for?
A perfect storm? perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back!! hey! Hey! Hey!

[Katy Perry:]
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on


[Katy Perry &amp; Skip Marley:]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm


[Lil Yachty:]
Lil Boat!
Chained to the beat, now
Feelin' good, got good vibes
I can feel it in my feet, now
Take a shot, baby loosen up
You're the star of the scene now
Went from readin' magazines to bein' on the cover
Get up in the groove now
Let me see you move now
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Lil Boat!


[Katy Perry:]
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on


[Katy Perry &amp; Skip Marley:]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song

To the rhythm
To the rhythm


[Lil Yachty:]
Take a shot, don't think about the hangover
You can get drunk, 'cause baby I'm a stay sober
Gon' hit the floor, let me see you move
You worked all week and studied hard in school
So let's have fun tonight
You can take your hair up out the bun tonight
Fool with me, let me see you get pretty for the city
Put my hand on your ass so they know that you're with me
I'm talkin' super sadity
You with me, you with me, you with me, you with me, you with me
I love you, Katy!
Lil Boat!


[Katy Perry &amp; Skip Marley:]

When I wanted you, you would not reciprocate
When I needed you, you would always show up late
But things have changed, and I've got the upper hand
You can run and I've got you eating out of my hand

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Get to work and give me money
That's more like it!
That's more like it!
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

When my birthday came, you would not remember it
When I got my period, you were inconsiderate
But tables turn, and it's great to be on top
Got you great to appreciate the good that you've got

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
I say where and when it happens
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
It's great to be the last one laughing
That's more like it!
That's more like it!
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

I like chocolate
And I like daisies
Maybe you better write this down
I love cashmere, and I want diamonds
Ready for my massage right now...

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner and bring it to me
That's more like it, that's more like it
Yeah, that's more like it
Yeah, it's about time
You get to work and give me money
That's more like it!
That's more like it!
(That's more like it, that's more like it)

Under a silver moon,
Tropical temperature
I feel my lotus bloom
Come closer
I want your energy,
I want your aura
You are my destiny,
My mantra

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la

Go down in history
Go down together,
Into infinity,
Forever
Your Cleopatra
Your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love,
A ride or die

I never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la


[Instrumental]

(Legendary lovers)
(Legendary lovers)
(Legendary lovers)

Oh, take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary (legendary)
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary (oh, take me down)
La la la la la

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun (underneath the sun)
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum (oh baby)

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
La la la la la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
La la la la la

What are you looking at?
(Yeah)

I saw this coming from a mile away
I saw a crack in the egg
A little rip in the page

I found your necklace on the floor
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one

You thought I'd cry
(You-thought-I'd-cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
(Ha-ha)

And all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)

You left your suit, you left your tie
And looked me in the eye
And swore that it was business baby
(Yeah, right)

And when you left I got a call
That started it all
And now it's not your business baby

You thought I'd cry
(You-thought-I'd-cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you
(Ha-Ha)

But all this time
(All-this-time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)

You're such a wreck
The cutest accident
Makes so much sense
You'll come back to me, oh

And I'll let you

Hey
Huh
You're back

Cause' it takes one, to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
(I'd-lie-here)
But the knife is in you're back
(In-your-back)

Cause' it takes one, to know one
(Hi, nice to meet you)
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here heartbroken
(I'll-lie-here)
But the knife is in your back
(In-your-back)

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke

I lost my fake ID but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me

You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town

Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night
Dressed up like Elvis? Why am I wearing your class ring?

Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime

Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

You got me into this
Information overload
Situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
Ha,and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town

Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me

Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas

That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter!

Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby

Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations, but do you ever wonder what we could have been?
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished

I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)

Saw a balloon floating away
I thought did someone let go, or did they lose it?
So strange you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know that I'll do the same

Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit

I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you

(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

We were a match but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
Sometimes I wonder what we could have been

I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

You'll always be in my orbit
You'll always be in my orbit

I remember when you used to be my every other thought
But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on
Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Blvd
I don't fuck with change, but lately I've been flipping coins a lot

I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie 'cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do
To reopen the wound
So I take a deep breath
And I save as draft

You don't have to subtweet me
My number's always been the same
But all's been said and done
Will we ever really close this case?
Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name

I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie 'cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do
To reopen the wound
So I take a deep breath
And I save as draft

I've heard you've done some changing
I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back
Fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go
Staring at a fork in the fucking road

I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie 'cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do
To reopen the wound
So I take a deep breath
And I save as draft

rise
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/katyperry/rise.html

I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me thrive
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the archetype

I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots--they run deep, oh

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my veins
I know it, I know it
And I will not negotiate
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, &quot;You're out of time,&quot;
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don't be surprised
I will still rise

I must stay conscious
Through the madness and chaos
So I call on my angels
They say

Oh, ye of so little faith
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in your veins
You know it, you know it
And you will not negotiate
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

'Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the vultures all start circling
They're whispering, &quot;You're out of time,&quot;
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don't be surprised
I will still rise

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know it, you know it
Still rise
Just fight it, just fight it
Don't be surprised
I will still rise

This was never the way I planned, not my intention.

I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion

It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on.

I'm curious for you, caught my attention.


[Chorus:]

I kissed a girl and I liked it,

the taste of her cherry chapstick.

I kissed a girl just to try it,

I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.

It felt so wrong,

it felt so right.

Don't mean I'm in love tonight.

I kissed a girl and I liked it (I liked it).


No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter.

You're my experimental game, just human nature.

It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave.

My head gets so confused, hard to obey.


[Chorus]


Us girls we are so magical,

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable.

Hard to resist, so touchable.

Too good to deny it.

Ain't no big deal, it's innocent.


[Chorus]

[end]
