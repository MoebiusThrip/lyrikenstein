I dried my eyes, now I crust them with sleep

I'll crust them over

She begged me &quot;Don't hate me&quot;

She spun me a story

Where winning looks like losing

And I'm winning every time

So thread spools, sweetie, get ready

Until my silk is sold


Growing up, whoa

Growing up, whoa

Growing up


Yeah

I'll find myself anew

Yeah

I'll find myself anew


I've dried my eyes, now it's &quot;Rushmore&quot;

I'm deep with futures like Chicago

No, Glenview never meant a thing to me

She never meant a thing to me

'Cept for putting idealists in a body bag

Forget it,

I'll go out tonight and piss on her doorstep

And listen to The Misfits &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; to swallow whole


Up, whoa

Growing up, whoa

Growing up


Go!

If home is where the heart is 
then we're all just fucked
I can't remember
I can't remember
And I want it so bad 
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember
The good old days

And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored or bored
just feels like a curse

My mind is a safe
And if I keep it in we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat 
off last night's stage
Just to feel like you

Milligrams in my head
Burning tobacco in my wind 
chasing the direction
Chasing the direction you went
You're a bottled star
The planets align
You're just like Mars
You shine in the sky
You shine in the sky

Are all the good times getting gone?
They come and go and go and come and go (come and go and come and go)
Oh yeah I've got a lot of friends who are stars
But some are just black holes

My mind is a safe
And if I keep it in we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat 
off last night's stage
Just to feel like you

And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored or bored
just feels like a curse

My mind is a safe
And if I keep it in we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat 
off last night's stage
Just to feel like you

If home is where the heart is 
then we're all just fucked

Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames

Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now

I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Said,
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Oh take a chance, let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, put a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawnshop heart trading up (trading up)

On the oracle in my chest,
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth
Free love on the streets but
In the alley it ain't that cheap, now

I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Said,
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Said,
I don't care just what you think
As long as it's about me, you said
I don't care just what you think
As long as it's about me, I said
I don't care (I don't care)
Said, I don't care (I don't care)
Said, I (I) don't (don't) care (care)
I (I) don't (don't) care (no I don't)
I don't care, (I said)
I don't care, (I said)
I (I) don't (don't) care (care)

I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery
Said,
I don't care what you think as long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

Wa aoh oh ooh

Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

Wa aoh oh ooh


Life's just a pace-car on death

Only less diligent

And when the two collide

It's no coincidence

The lights are on and everybody's home


The only thing suicidal here is the doors

We had a good run

Even I have to admit

Life's just a pace-car on death

Only less diligent


Hell or glory

I don't want anything in between

Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes

And daddy said &quot;you gotta show the world the thunder&quot;

Woah oh oh

The thunder

Woah oh oh

The thunder

Woah oh oh 

The thunder


Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

Wa aoh oh ooh

Oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh

Wa aoh oh ooh


We didn't come to compete

This is a demonstration

Even the young ones become irrelevant

They always bring up how you've changed

Never the same person when I go to sleep

As when I wake up

As when I wake up

Bop bop ba dop

Ba dop op ba dop

Ba dop op ba dop

Ba dop op ba dop


Hell or glory

I don't want anything in between

Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes

And daddy said &quot;you gotta show the world the thunder&quot;

Woah oh oh

The thunder

Woah oh oh

The thunder

Woah oh oh 

The thunder

Woah oh oh

They say we are what we are
But we don't have to be.
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way.
I'll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame.
I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams.

Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
Oooooooh,
I try to picture me without you but I can't

'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long.
And live with me forever now,
You pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long.

We could be immooooooo- immortals,
Immooooooo- immortals,
Immooooooo- immortals,
Immooooooo- immortals.

Sometimes the only pay-off for having any faith
Is when it's tested again and again everyday.
I'm still comparing your past to my future.
It might be your wound but they're my sutures.

Oooooooh
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)
Oooooooh,
I try to picture me without you but I can't

'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long.
And live with me forever now,
You pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long.

We could be immooooooo- immortals,
Immooooooo- immortals,

Immortals,
And live with me forever now,
Pull the blackout curtains down,

We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long.
We could be immooooooo- immortals,
Immooooooo- immortals,
Immooooooo- immortals,
Immooooooo- immortals,
(Immortals)

I comb the crowd and pick you out

My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out

It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed

&quot;To I swear, I say&quot;

&quot;To I swear, I say&quot;


To hands between legs, to &quot;whatever it takes&quot;

To drinks at the club to the bar

To the keys to your car

To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door


To the &quot;love&quot;, I left my conscience pressed

Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer

&quot;What did it ever do for me&quot; I say (I say, I say, I say)

It never calls me when I'm down

Love never wanted me

But I took it anyway

Put your ear to the speaker

And choose love or sympathy

But never both

Love never wanted me


&quot;I hoped you choked

And crashed your car&quot;

Hey &quot;tear catcher&quot;, that's all that you are

And ever were

From the start

I swear, I say

I swear, I say


To hands between legs, to &quot;whatever it takes&quot;

To drinks at the club to the bar

To the keys to your car

To hotel stairs to the emergency exit door


To the &quot;love&quot;, I left my conscience pressed

Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer

&quot;What did it ever do for me&quot; I say

It never calls me when I'm down

Love never wanted me

But I took it anyway

Put your ear to the speaker

And choose love or sympathy

But never both, no


To the &quot;love&quot; I left my conscience pressed

Through the keyhole I watched you dress

Kiss and tell

(Loose lips sink ships)

[x3]


To the &quot;love&quot; I left my conscience pressed 
[x3]

Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer

&quot;What did it ever do for me&quot; I say

I'm a young one

Stuck in the thoughts

Of an old one's head

When all the others were just stirring awake

I'm trying to trick myself to fall asleep again, woah


My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell

Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well


Hurry, hurry

You put my head in such a flurry, flurry

Oh freckle, freckle

What makes you so special?

What makes you so special?

I'm gonna leave you

I'm gonna teach you

How we're all alone

How we're all alone


Guild me, build me

It's your club, so let me in (let me in)

Knowing how heartwarming

It is inside your skin


My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell

Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well


Hurry, hurry

You put my head in such a flurry, flurry

Oh freckle, freckle

What makes you so special?

What makes you so special?

I'm gonna leave you

I'm gonna teach you

How we're all alone

How we're all alone


How we're all alone


Hurry, hurry

You put my head in such a flurry, flurry

Oh freckle, freckle

What makes you so special?

What makes you so special?

I'm gonna leave you

I'm gonna teach you

How we're all alone

How we're all alone


[Interlude:]

Mama

If we don't take the medication

We won't sleep for days

We won't sleep for days

Mama

If we pray to the lord

Does he sing on a stage?

Does he sing on a stage?

We waste it all in the back of a long dark car

And I'm a sunshine machine

I want to get stuck

I want to get stuck

And be golden in your memory
