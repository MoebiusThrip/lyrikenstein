Listen

To the horror of satan sea

Listen

To the guns of superman

Well I say

Return to a platinum stranger

Hooked on

The enemy under your skin

Panic

Despite the heart of stone

Doomsday

For all the beautiful people 


Hey I know what I want now

And it's right in front of me

And I know how to get it

The good things in life are

Always free 


Landscape of greed and hate

It keeps me going

Victim of what's inside you

Outside of truth

Only hurts now when I laugh

Live by fire

Forever is a long long time

War is hell 


Hanging man twitches in agony

Death rattle shakes itself free

Raise you hand to the mountain

Drown in your own bloody fountain

Shadows become longer the sun

Burns down

Don't need to look I am found 


Lucky

If you still remember your name

Freedom

Visions of a showdown

Blood is

Boiling in the midnight sun

Sizzling

Like the enemy under your skin

Priests gathered at the graves
No one's soul was saved
They were fooling with the young man's pain
The child's mind had gone insane

Born in heaven, raised in hell
An angel of death that never fell
Trapped in a world I never made
I watch the sky turn black and fade

The scene of the crime was empty
Nothing left for you to see
But you could hear the sound
Of the bodies breaking the ground

Plague of zombies run away
remember hell came today
Scream, scream and scream again
My days of terror shall begin

In the hills they beat a song
Of how all was lost and all was gone
See the figures glowing in the night
Shadows dancing in flaming light

A knuckle duster is the most deadly in the ponderous pace 

Of floating justice single-handed dynamo. 

Take it now, say the way we want and not for you to point the finger

combustible in a word fuck'n. Say the word and you'll be free. 

Contunue your journey Superman say I am we can put you down 

not a wizard-boy question just a demonstration of definition. 

Silver city crusading to the top of a fug'n bone break most 

vile experiment ready to eat your ass. Clockface. Bigtime.

We are. Somekind. Say it. Like always. 

Sound + silence promote the zero. 

A steel hammer game from me to you, but I don't mind the matter. 

Ratmouth don't know what you need just know what you want.

'Walking dead' crawling bloodthirsty Hollywood demon flower grow in the 

Valley of Love like a freak highway accident.

Last ride rolling down say hi-density. 

Glory stomp gonna make the girl in the room +

in the house turn and see that I ain't there...

Fast, fast jungle king of the road 
Fast, fast jungle got a suicide machine 
Big bad jungle flying down high
Down the sewer streets 
Sailing down the river streets 
Destination light neon number forty-two grind
And move my way found 
And kick my way down 
And save my way 
Hanging on psychic ride 
Sliding down friday's child 
Get out now before you cripple 
Shell crowds a carbon long 
While a twisted root digs the citys 
Hold careless saint preach of love 
Modern trash scream for war 
Citycide going nowhere
Citycide nowhere which ung end in a dragstrip crash 
Leatherman singing for the past 
Painted eyes got a face to remember 
King of control 
Dead September 
Do what I say not what I do 
Leave it to the true
Beasts the mindless, 
Motherless dog bitch 
Spread her life on the fucking floor 
Rip her legs in the shattered glass 
Retaliation murders 
Retaliation murders 
Now the rot control the tooth 
And the dirt in the
World say freak father to brother, 
Sister to mother 
Taste the failure from one another 
Sometimes all that glitters gold 
When its howling in the widows grave 
Where a broken skull speak like a god 
And the head-stone reads 
Buddy holly
Join the resurrection rave on 
In my direction rave on 
Got to
Rave on rave on rave on rave on

An unparallelleled account of collapse appearing like yourself 

liberation appearing like myself mutilation. 

Hold still now, nobody turns, said yeah!

Motive spasm my back aches. 

Termination detentation, da-la-sco..
