I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both

An older version of me
Is she perverted like me?
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
Does she speak eloquently?
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

'Cause the love that you gave, that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you die, 'til you die?
But you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know

Did you forget about me,
Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face
How quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you die, 'til you die?
But you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed: that was me, and I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it

And every time I scratch my nails down someone else's back I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?

Well, I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

I am here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

ironic
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/ironic.html

An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic... don't you think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought
&quot;Well isn't this nice...&quot;
And isn't it ironic... don't you think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures

Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
You think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face

A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife
And isn't it ironic...don't you think
A little too ironic...and, yeah, I really do think...

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought... it figures

Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
Helping you out

comfort
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/comfort.html

We spent our days in contemplation
Too much too soon
and though it hurts to let it linger on and on
You're all I need

What will my heart allow
When loneliness holds me down

So move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
But I guess you can't come out for a while

We spent our nights in conversation
Too much to prove
And I've been a fool to let it linger on and on
You're all I see

Shaping our love we found
impossible higher ground

So move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
Well I guess you can't come out for a while
Won't you move closer and comfort me now
Move over if you care for me
Well I've come to learn how love can cage you
tear you up then try to replace you
I guess I won't come out for a while
With no warning, no pause, no pity

Why-y -- why-why-y-y

Don't wake awake my soul anymore
Just stay away from me a little while
Where will you go when we walk away

oooo-oooh -- ooo-ohh

My only comfort is gone
With no warning, no pause, no pity
[end]
noapologies
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/noapologies.html

Whenever we talk about sun all I see is the rain

It's like looking for tears in a ocean

I'm hearing your words like the wind

They blow straight through my heart

Will you ever give in to emotion


And we hurt the ones that we love the most

Why we do only heaven knows

And I don't know why I'm still holding on...holding on


[CHORUS:]

I reach in my heart to see

If your love is alive in me

But now I feel alone

My feelings turn to stone

My heart makes no apologies


When an apology's made it isn't always enough

To erase all the past in a moment

Whenever I need you the most

You always leave me behind

With a word from your lips I'm alone


You've been blind not to realize

All the love that I hold inside

So tell me why do I keep holding on...holding on


[CHORUS]


What I need is your sympathy

Like a light flowing into me

But I will never give up holding on...holding on


[CHORUS]


...my heart makes no apologies no no

my feelings turn to stone... I make no apologies
[end]
rest
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/rest.html

All these relief-givers
The needle sure revs in the red
Chemicals like drugs
They feel like they come from my best friend
You think me a coward but I am a warrior
With many voices in my head
When I looked around and I reached out
I saw no alternative

And God rest, God rest our souls
And this substance is the only comfort I know
He's been hurting for a while
Can we cut this man some slack
And let him lie down, let him lie down

We are a country desperate for the embryonic
I'm cold and I'm hungry
And I yearn for a hand on my forehead
You think it's a walk in the park and it's easy
&quot;She's got it as good as it gets&quot;
This misunderstanding's a line between living
And being a walking dead

And God rest, please rest our souls
And the more I take the less comfort I know
She's been pushing for a while
Can we cut this woman slack
And let her lie down, let her lie down
The more that you hurl at me
The more I will curl up in my bed

Where's the humanity?
Aren't we all hovering around the same end?
Door number 1, 2 and 3 have been promises
That aren't real enough to be kept
You wish me a speedy recovery
But when you turn I plumb the depths

And God rest, God please rest our souls
This is the surest exit I have known
We've been hurting for a while
Can we cut ourselves some slack
And let us lie down, let us lie down
Let us lie down, let me lie down

eighteasysteps
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/eighteasysteps.html

How to stay paralyzed by fear of abandonment

How to defer to men in solveable predicaments

How to control someone to be a carbon copy of you

How to have that not work and have them run away from you


How to keep people at arms length and never get too close

How to mistrust the ones who supposedly love the most

How to pretend you're fine and don't need help from anyone

How to feel worthless unless you're serving or helping someone


[Chorus:]

I'll teach you all this in 8 easy steps

A course of a lifetime you'll never forget

I'll show you how to in 8 easy steps

I'll show you how leaderships looks when taught by the best


How to hate women when you're supposed to be a feminist

How to play all pious when you're really a hypocrite

How to hate god when you're a prayer and a spiritualist

How to sabotage your fantasies by fears of success


[Chorus]


I've been doing research for years

I've been practicing my ass off

I've been training my whole life for this moment I swear to you

Culminating just to be this well-versed leader before you


[Chorus]


How to lie to yourself and thereby to everyone else

How to keep smiling when you're thinking of killing yourself

How to numb a la holic to avoid going within

How to stay stuck in blue by blaming them for everything


[Chorus]

handinmypocket
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alanismorissette/handinmypocket.html

I'm broke but I'm happy
I'm poor but I'm kind
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high but I'm grounded
I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby

And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a high five

I feel drunk but I'm sober
I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm tired but I'm working, yeah
I care but I'm restless
I'm here but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry baby

And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's gonna be quite alright
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flicking a cigarette

And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a peace sign

I'm free but I'm focused
I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughing
I'm brave but I'm chickenshit
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby

And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
But I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playing a piano

And what it all comes down to, my friends, yeaha,
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailing a taxi cab
