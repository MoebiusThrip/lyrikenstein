must street and already lingers
knows garden to big
and forget layers
a ways swinging
 
love studded flow of grave
flunkies most you aim tell
be will and forever leave
want love hell
 
wisdom you diamond tough use
a ugly
be love taste will see
get will under a lonely
 
i more bright riders
you stronger duct dress
