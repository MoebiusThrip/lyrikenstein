break trailer's baby yes heart stepped better
much done we're kinda superstardom's tried just water
 
feel love next we're around
superstardom's then water once we're alone friend
 
we've run well daughter eight plus mouth
something cypher we've seems normal daughter strength
 
made then salem's fight stay rhyming stamps
new hear crime gaping unfolds beats
