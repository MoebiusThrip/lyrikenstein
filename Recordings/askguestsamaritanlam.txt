ask guest samaritan lampshade ooooo
bringing though the from agent june
others every happy done
 
behind hair chicago and out gold movement
spilt we the birds hills fuckin' today
suddenly i droppin' stairway
 
hedgerow lied alarmed ground
gold left rings bittersweet
they heavy forget
 
wasn't feelin' the dearly dance class
paradise everybody did ooo bruising guest
burn lead signals sunset
