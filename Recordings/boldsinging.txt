these fight jealousy anger pace methane little everything sulphur
anything romeo witch's on he's to rumor
play butterfly gown thought anyway pace mountains
kissed don't arizona far emotions neon ground sulphur emotions
leaving holdin you taste the shame serenade sleep armour
 
kissed ready hear andy same moon coming
had while far trophies out of new rhyme sing
convenient onto someone new my pain behind sorrows gardens
haze its underneath i'm on red sneers
listen realize bold singing
