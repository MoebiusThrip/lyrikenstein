as through reborn my live seem
keep 'til land 'em
plan life cry back
kill in clean black
kid lines love avoid my eyes room
 
give a doing comes tell
as take it's most want steal
pain more tell rip over
was void land path sever
erase fire one's under wall
 
soon comes tell you me away
knock black word sour deep way
through shut sun you know legs prey
they step ran your black army
sad apart free away
 
through silver know
sets truth cry inferno
their echoes pass a
i soon he'll piece amnesia
we did vein and soon
