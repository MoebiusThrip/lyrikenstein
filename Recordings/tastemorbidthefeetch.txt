taste morbid the feet cha
i fell well the
siren its' life the i'll falls
lens the frame white
 
time the though
inflate sleep the their named prophet
i shades road soul
weapons was the like let
 
dry pathetic burden a stake took just
on under the rambles hide
take right the from score
calm the outside
