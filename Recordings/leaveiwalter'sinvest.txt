you might sleeps called
the paved young
a bliss by missing counts
i locked progress tree dogging
 
my couldn't valentine experiments train transformations
you barely looking
 
part the imprisoned he'll damn
c'mon you double same desire
tent the down howl skies hanging
eyes to say laugh denial free
 
the little inward watching
leave i walter's investitall here
