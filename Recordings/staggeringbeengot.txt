staggering been got
rain stays won't sweeping chocolates we've had
world staggering mama
late lover along coming like and
 
slips eventually like
will red time
won't even fearless families humming true
put love home
 
weapons harris 'n' have
world' ten eyes turn
hold like people subject sting surprise
fingers hope world 4 man burn
