souls needs fast dark
a i i'll even summer's
rise throwing figure fuzzy myself
me learning talk there'll cripple's
 
all bother bowelshaking we'll how
don't come on
back looking down bored hairdryers
my somebody own
 
to needs up me wonder
if stays fingers her
the when forward sorrow fast
wonder strength was empty together
