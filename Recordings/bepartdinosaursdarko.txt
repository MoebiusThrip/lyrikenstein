wound breathe to huh
most you fit medicate
the holiness could such
all think angels white
 
unconditional to til towards
healed have first transformation
the falling themselves diamonds
you ways bandit champion
 
all hearts low want misses
be dance crave been maker
and sax sees
all grain compress line fear
 
opened ugly a fit wouldn't
be part dinosaurs dark out
