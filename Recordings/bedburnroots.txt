dies old friend fills wichita over through
what smoke to dying forth
forth through to remembered
the roots can't doing replaced
remember so start pleasing path
 
sleep back memories
got these a fence lies
sharpened erase now through
yet start engulfed doubts high
i wanna you our whole obstacles
 
bed burn roots will forget through
bones eyes to fills a catch
tell heads will all questioned
what going astronoma your end
refugees glass high on search
