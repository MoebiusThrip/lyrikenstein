because seven how desire blackened it
wall or doing wait
i'm because words speak talk
of the floor wanna army think
draws break the losing my great
 
refugees i'll to souls
the can't given give want fools
because smoke words starting now arm's
it's drip bed you creep one's
of remember loved pebbles
 
refugees fight glass
a nothing floor is senseless
won't apart before off
what word turns unbridled mind of
the stays and clean lines
 
because wanna arm's
drip by floor left karma's
doing before to
apart the taking surprise on into
speak soon arm's
