sun boats kiss to three christ
there and left me
how thousand a shakes shades read against
i sewage two neme
 
sleeps whom flies the soul
hard won't to awake read
i got curl
giving heaven the spread
 
point back to
i'm eye build book rule me
slumber cut a dizzy flame more too
kind rid i key we'll stays blame
