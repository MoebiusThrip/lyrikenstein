you waking it's anyway
feet you blessed high believe has
i high serenade hour cannot messiahs
 
every you loving camp alive
eye you its feel brown
to drawn
 
greed a sin messiah cut
choosing i late friendboy godforsaken laid
strip to box afraid
 
choose replace a postcard unlockable dirty
past you corner losing names
you descends give rhymes
