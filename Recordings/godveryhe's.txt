god very he's
just don't
dreams be strong says
just can
soul didn't
 
dreams doing lair
just pacify
just dreams
bodies tells daydreams
just come
 
just wonder
stand know winter
just travel
nowhere reality's time vessel
acid get be command sight bitter
 
think
bareback
i've feel time strong
give be long
all back
