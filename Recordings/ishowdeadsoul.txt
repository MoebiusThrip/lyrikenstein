they wave i tired
some all big dead
i show dead soul
and us man guy load lead
 
show swear paved dead is them
warm work 'til
until get take
am cool to fool still
 
woo baby we're let much
poor in cold
cute cold fate love long
she able a hold
 
dead sick run
says tears for we're lee's
fool all bear dead
i'm well to long warm misses
