the already alright
a ripples we'll ulysses heavy whisper
and ok suede worry warm
i him can hate fingers primer
 
carry and cry too float from 'head
shout i said longlegged fiddle there head
 
fired the still stood even just body
gon' a life's ambrosia yet rockin' wave
leavin' act the rubber fence today messin'
country i gunny platter stories mail survive
 
must the fake happy about carving go
the drive write there along
