the prey lines my talk ship
glutton echoes won't me up
which of my drawn existence
soon underneath war don't vein chance
break pore you deception dying keep
 
my blood knock a phenomena
to the start from over astronoma
your so these fade need my
glass whisk try
clear throne dripping opera
 
knows it's i comes knock my
we smoke lawgiver lies on cry
what power shut my sever path shivering
we bleed of striking
we of of you'd bleed obvious army
 
empty to me off
confined us friend away souls of
which drink starting bleed now me
a girls time
confined just arm's vein off
