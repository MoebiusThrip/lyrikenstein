the memory doesn't what's like
to kept eyes getting erased
visions scene you shouldn't
i'm platter lump sound shared
 
you believe
my sound lying said day wrapped
 
hoped you anymore
painted to revealing faking power
or and throw can't see done
and made used wanted offer
 
bear loss a lotus gon' where
no and street enough angel forever
