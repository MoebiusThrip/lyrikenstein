to me off pretty time
of morning hit bleed
dig come buying out some
i pushed decode my chance eternal
you in somethin' jungle behind bother
me borderline daddy desires stumbled spiral
so engulfed ounce another
my astray shadows loud later kind
i too faces land those feels
has under fuck touch ta end
you voice while circles file spells
and fruit under heat
a been well buying matter feet
