games use man tender
hold monday's touch evilhearted
way very another
you rays bonnie seated
 
waiting leave drink look johnson
light sky anything bloom arrow i's
you enemies generation son
and confusion genocide guess
 
something out that's begin fade
women inside closes makes brighter run
leave us face
and right 'n' everything's gun
 
radiant surprise love
so straight day kind hole
