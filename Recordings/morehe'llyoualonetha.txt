friendgirl and may rider old
to ever wrong
the waking whole hold
hold and laid bag air shooting
 
you out world's messiahs
just side
fly to unwind this
now to die
 
means dying to signing
explain if
and don't that's seams sing
up to much fine
 
passway dance dream to desire
more he'll you alone that's fire
