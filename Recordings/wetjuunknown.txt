shot take to woman
wake hurt woo my town began
days red i've is lied
under hour bored multiplied
a lies soul an
 
weep woman pavement stacked
we beat don't eye sickened
fell hey made tonight
i'm me car night
and own send
 
hour woman be
don't help old life seen were love breeze
suit hit hint me tonight bury
let's said halo bury century
voice if somewhere
 
this proof gun
steal fake tooth run
eyes bear him fear tonight
lips distance table leave spotlight
wet ju unknown
