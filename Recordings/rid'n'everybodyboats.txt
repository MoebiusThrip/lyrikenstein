rid 'n' everybody boats me
can't read inside i
a again flame
enough go bird to book back brki
 
to hate disease draped aside
i egy think eternal
you'll you staring rule hearts fade
and shall fall
 
car lives fly build loud i'll pray
i fall cannot give
lighten the happy
hey today rainbow to rag road live
