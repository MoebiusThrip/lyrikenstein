the dogging rock'n'roll occupied own
the vain same bathed she's
i asked folks goddess
 
you honest fire world's simple
you comin' made occupy here
i alive standin' there
 
you has prop
i rockin'to deep think
the rhymes lay burst back
 
you maker kenneth wings free
you through booze burst well's
you bob booze writing's sadness
