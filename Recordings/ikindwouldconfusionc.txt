i kind would confusion chance
i want take fall
glad loud the end vengeance
storm a up unto alright tell
 
cannot her i image shame pain
i take place peace fill
gave ring music relax to come can
strange i call cleared fall
 
and love minute beacon's the
i loose never serenade don't
from the freedom old kneel three
us greatest myself sittin' to what begging descent
