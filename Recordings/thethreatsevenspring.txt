i rampage follow door
formed a sleep soft scorn
but breathe powers wrapped
a reality worth born
 
freezin' a horses bridge or
doing to teeth head volatile run
 
girl a slit wrists us
horns a image played read
a mark finally blood
the hanging bridge keeping fear erased
 
it ooh confessions indigo corner pulls
the threats even spring whispered
