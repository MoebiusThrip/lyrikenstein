opens a floor old
angel the apologize cold sets
the smile rainbow believer would
the chill home folks its
 
a closes advice falls
falls her a blow gone someone
the right glands lies endless
a pit circle fine
 
you hers
intentions you crashes
the 'bout deal know feathers
the forever truck misery hopeless
 
rollin' mother a blow
you face radiant late new
